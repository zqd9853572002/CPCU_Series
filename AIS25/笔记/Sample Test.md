# Part B

The following case relates to questions 54 through 60.



Quality First is a TPA that handles mainly workers compensation claims. One of Quality First's clients is the Warehaus Group, an international conglomerate of warehouse operations. The Warehaus Group has been experiencing increases in lost wage claims mainly from employees experiencing lower back injuries.
While reading a textbook on managing bodily injury claims, Cindy, a claim representative at Quality First, learned that, when potentially complicated injuries were identified early and medical case management was applied, wage loss claim costs dropped dramatically because workers were able to return to work sooner. Under the existing process at Quality First, medical case management was not applied until more than a month had passed from the date of the accident. Cindy wondered if there was anything her company could do to get nurse case managers involved earlier. Cindy mapped out the following existing process. She contacted her Risk Management Information Systems department and obtained the average days for each step of the process.

    C. Reduced claim payments through earlier medical case management
    D. All of the above

    D. A vision statement describing the importance of returning people to work as soon as possible

    

59. Based on the team's recommendation for process improvement, a nurse case manager obtains a report on the injury as soon as the type of injury is identified. This occurs either when the loss is reported or shortly after it has been assigned to the claim representative. In either case the changes reduce the average time for medical case management from thirty-one days to eight days. The reduction in time is an example of
    A. Visioning.
    B. Good "management" in the traditional sense of the word.
    C. Process improvement.
