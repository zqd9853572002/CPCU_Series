3.1. Reinsurance Calculation

Which of the following statements is true with regard to reinsurance calculations?

I. Mountain Insurance Company has entered into a 80 percent quota share treaty with Swift Reinsurance Company. An 80,000 loss occurs that is subject to the reinsurance treaty. Under the terms of the treaty, Swift would indemnify Mountain for the loss of 64,000.

II. A primary insurer has a five-line surplus share treaty with a 50 million limit. For a specific loss exposure with coverage limit needs of 30 million, the primary insurer's line guide permits a 5 million line. The percentage used to cede premiums and losses to the reinsurer would be 80%.

III. The losses listed below arose from three policies and one occurrence: Policy A, loss amount 300,000; Policy B, loss amount 400,000; Policy C, loss amount 900,000. Given these losses, the difference between the amount of loss a primary insurer would recover under a 750,000 xs 250,000 per policy excess of loss reinsurance treaty versus a 800,000 xs 800,000 per occurrence excess of loss reinsurance treaty would be 250,000.

(A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D) All of the above

Answer

I. Reinsurance cession is 80%, 0.8 x 80,000. = 64,000.

II. A specific loss exposure is 30mil., primary insurerâ€™s retention is 5mil., and reinsurance cession amount is 25mil., so the percentage of reinsurance cession is 83.33%.

III. The difference between (A) and (B) is 50,000.
