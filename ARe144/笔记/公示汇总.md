公式

# 一、QSR profit-sharing ceding commission

## 1. 计算estimated QSR premium

- estimated QSR premium = estimated subject premium * QSR percentage

## 2. 扣减再保公司和直保公司的cost

### （1）Costs and Desired Profit

- ri cost and minimum profit = ri cost and minimum profit percentage * estimated QSR premium

### （2）Flat Ceding Commission

- flat ceding commission = flat ceding commission percentage * estimated QSR premium

### （3）Estimated Average Loss and LAE

- loss ratio = (loss + LAE) / earned premium

- estimated Average Loss and LAE = estimated QSR premium * projected loss ratio

  ​														  = estimated QSR premium * (loss + LAE) / earned premium

## 3. Step 3: 确定profit-sharing commission

- estimated premium amount for profit sharing = estimated QSR premium - ri cost and minimum profit - flat ceding commission - estimated Average Loss and LAE
- estimated profit-sharing commission = profit-sharing commission percentage * estimated premium amount for profit sharing

# 二、QSR的评估

## 1. Current Evaluation

### （1）计算subject loss ratio

- subject loss ratio = subject incurred losses / subject earned premium

### （2）计算ceding commission

- ceding commission = provisional commission + [0.5 * (specified loss ratio - subject loss ratio)]

### （3）比较ceding commission和minimum commission

### （4）计算ceded written premium

- ceded written premium = QSR percentage * subject written premium

### （5）计算ceded earned premium

- ceded earned premium = QSR percentage * subject earned premium

### （6）计算ceded incurred loss

- ceded incurred loss = subject loss ratio * ceded earned premium

## 2. Historical Evaluation

###  （1）Surplus Relief Effect

#### 1）计算ceded unearned premium

- ceded unearned premium = ceded written premium - ceded earned premium

#### 2）计算surplus relief effect

- surplus relief effect = provisional commission * ceded unearned premium

### （2）Underwriting Profit Margin

- 前提条件

  - 先确定使用ceding commission 还是minimum commission作为ceded commission
  - commission = ceding commission * ceded earned premium
  - expense = general expense loading * ceded earned premium

- underwriting profit margin = (ceded earned premium - commission - expense - loss) / ceded earned premium 

  ​												= [ceded earned premium - (ceded commission * ceded earned premium) - (general expense loading * ceded earned premium) - ceded incurred loss] / ceded earned premium



# 三、SSR - Limit profile

- ceded percentage = (midpoint - retention) / midpoint

- ceded dollar amount = ceded percentage * premium account

- capacity ratio = premium amount / policyholder surplus

  ​						= (premium amount - ceded dollar amount) / policyholder surplus



# 四、PPR - premium percentage

- total loss cost = Estimated subject premium * (loss cost rate + unused limits charge)

- sum of the loading = internal expense - brokerage - retrocessional expense - profit and contingency

- ri premium = total loss cost / (1 - sum of the loading)

  ​					= Estimated subject premium * (loss cost rate + unused limits charge) / (1 - internal expense - brokerage - retrocessional expense - profit and contingency)

- premium percentage = reinsurance premium / estimated subject premium

  

# 五、CXOL

## 1. reinstatement premium

- per occurrence limit reinstated percentage = loss / per occurrence limit
- reinstatement premium = per occurrence limit reinstated percentage * earned ri premium for the contract year

# 六、CATXOL

## 1. Payback of prior loss

- payback period = ri limit / ri premium paid
- Rate on line (ROL) = ri premium paid / ri limit

# 七、Annual Statement

## 1. Underwriting and Investment Exhibit（UIE）

### （1）Part 1 - Premiums Earned

- premium earned = 本年度的net written premium + 上年度（12月31日的）unearned premium - 本年度 unearned premium

### （2）Part 1B - Premiums Written

- net written premium = direct business + reinsurance assumed - reinsurance ceded
  - reinsurance assumed = reinsurance assumed from affiliates + reinsurance assumed from non-affiliates
  - reinsurance ceded = reinsurance ceded to affiliates + reinsurance ceded to non-affiliates

# 八、regulation

- capacity ratio = insurer net written premium / policyholder surplus
  - 正常范围：<= 300% (3 to 1)

- surplus aid to surplus ratio = ceding commission on unearned ceded premium / policyholder surplus
  - 正常范围：<= 25%



# 九、loss reserve

- incurred loss = paid loss + loss reserve + LAE reserve
- case reserve = claim representative估算的ultimate loss - paid loss

- case reserve（Tabular method）= present value * annual benefit amount

- bulk reserve - reported loss reserve = earned premium * x% - paid loss
- IBNR reserve = ultimate loss - reported incurred loss

- estimated ultimate loss = incurred and reported loss * ultimate loss development factor

## 1. Loss Triangle Method（loss development method/ chain link method/ chain ladder method/ link ratio method）

- IBNR reserve = estimated ultimate loss - incurred and reported loss

  		​						= incurred and reported loss * ultimate loss development factor - incurred and reported loss

  ​						= incurred and reported loss * (ultimate loss development factor - 1) 
  
    						

## 2. BF method的步骤

- initial expected loss = ultimate earned premium * initial expected loss ratio

- IBNR reserve = initial expected loss * expected percentage of unreported loss
