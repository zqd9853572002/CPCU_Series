# Data Management Fundamentals

- Objective: Explain how cyber risk extends data professionals’ roles beyond traditional data quality to data security.

- Data is the lifeblood of every organizational function. But simply having lots of data doesn’t necessarily help organizations understand problems, answer critical questions, or make faster and better decisions.

- To gain a competitive advantage, maintain profitability, and satisfy customers, an organization must be able to trust and act on its data. That's why it's important not only to protect data with a holistic cyber risk management strategy, but also to ensure that data underlying customer interactions and strategic decision-making maintains the integrity associated with quality data.

  [Richard Morales Talks About Data Quality]()

- It may seem obvious that data must be of sound quality. Some decision makers may even assume that internal data has been vetted properly and believe that external data is gathered only from reliable sources. Yet making sure that you’re using high-quality data should not be left to unchecked assumptions. Data quality is a relative, not an absolute, concept. Data may be of adequate quality for one particular analysis while being inappropriate for another purpose.

- Data quality depends in part on the security of the data. Organizations must safeguard the accuracy of both their information systems and the data on which important decisions are based. Data may be inaccurate because of flaws in the system’s ability to detect erroneous transactions or a lack of security. Additionally, without adequate controls, those with access to data may be able to change it.

- Let's examine the two pillars of data management: data quality and data security.

## Data Quality

- An important step to ensure quality data is a systematic and purpose-driven review of data. Data quality can be imagined as a combination of these characteristics:
  - Validity and accuracy are overlapping characteristics. A piece of data is valid if it's consistent with its classification. For example, a database of supply chain businesses and their home countries might note that a particular supplier is based in Japan. Japan would be recognized as a valid country name. However, if that supplier is actually based in Australia, the data, while still valid, isn't accurate. In short, just because data is technically valid does not mean it's accurate.
  - Completeness refers to whether data reflects all that is necessary for the analysis.
  - Timeliness refers to the appropriateness of current data to support the initiative. Current interest rates (and trends), for example, will have a direct impact on the timing of a bank’s new business-loan program.
  - Data lineage is a systematic process of tracing data from its source to its destination and identifying any inconsistent or inaccurate data.
- Other important data-quality principles include these:
  - Appropriateness. Is the data appropriate for the intended objective? In some cases, current and historical data may be relevant. For example, a previous business loan offering may provide some pertinent historical information for the bank. Sales history of similar products in the UK may help pinpoint geographic targets.
  - Material limitations and alternatives. If a geographic target has limited prospects (based on analysis of prospect size and need), the software company may need to find an alternative city or defined territory.
  - Sampling methods. Sampling may uncover invalid or inaccurate data and facilitate prevention or necessary adjustments.
- Data quality is just one aspect of the more comprehensive administrative process for acquiring, validating, storing, protecting, and processing data called data management. Data management principles dictate fundamental dimensions of data quality such as accuracy, validity, and completeness. Other dimensions (concerning how data is stored), such as consistency, flexibility, precision, and granularity, serve as additional support of key quality factors.

## Data Security

- Organizations have data management and administrative processes for acquiring, validating, storing, and processing data. Under the corporate discipline of data governance, many organizations appoint committees to define rules and standards involved in processing and storing data. Managing data and ensuring its accuracy and trustworthiness are key components of corporate risk management. Protecting that data is another matter altogether.

- Basic processes in any data security program should include defining a plan and policies, managing who has access to the data, developing stronger passwords, and establishing extensive backup procedures.

  > - Other security practices include encryption, file backups, and firewalls. While these practices are highly familiar, not all of them are appropriate for use by every organization. Success with them relies on understanding your organization’s strengths and weaknesses well enough to implement the best practices.

- Here are some practices commonly suggested for enhanced data security:

  - Encrypting data using software or hardware technology
  - Storing file backups off-site
  - Maintaining software protection against viruses and malware
  - Automating application and system software updates
  - Using a firewall (a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules)
  - Disabling unnecessary file- and media-sharing processes
  - Deleting old files from cloud or off-site backups 
  - Implementing privacy settings immediately upon gaining new software

- Software-based security solutions can be used to encrypt data to block the use of the data if stolen. However, it’s still imperative to do everything possible to prevent unauthorized access. A malicious program or hacker could corrupt data to make it unrecoverable. Hardware-based security solutions can prevent read and write access to data, offering strong protection against tampering and unauthorized access.

To date, the retail chain has not invested at all in data security, and the employees are resistant to making changes. However, management realizes the chain could easily be put out of business if customer data is breached. Juan isn’t sure where to start. Identify some basic processes that should be part of any data security program and that Juan can implement while working to fully understand the organization’s risks.

Juan should start with implementing these practices as he begins to work on the retail chain’s data security program.

## Summary

- Organizations must protect data with a holistic cyber risk management strategy and also ensure that data underlying customer interactions and strategic decision-making maintains the integrity associated with quality data.

# A Global View of Cybersecurity

- Objective: Recommend strategies and practices for organizations to manage the cyber risk presented by the international nature of networks.

- As the worldwide network of public and private web servers continues to expand, online boundaries become less defined and more difficult to control. Threats can come from all areas of the globe, and organizations must continually search for new ways to manage the challenges of global cybersecurity.

- Large corporate data breaches and malicious cyber activity threaten banking, commerce, and infrastructure systems on national levels. Both organizations and governments are aware of the need to manage these ever-evolving cyber risks through best practices and regulations.

  > [Pamela Eck Talks About Cyber Risk]()

- Global cyberattacks have made it clear that cybersecurity extends beyond physical boundaries for all countries, and cybersecurity should be addressed on a worldwide platform by answering key questions.

## Who Is Responsible for Governing Global Cybersecurity?

- Some countries favor establishing an international body to govern global cybersecurity. The United Nations (UN) led an effort to find common ground, and after member states presented their views on international law and cooperation, it affirmed that international law does apply to activities in cyberspace.

- A more moderate attempt is the Budapest Convention, the first international treaty concerning cybercrime, which provides a framework that enables international collaboration on cybercrime investigations. Other promising group efforts have focused on agreements on a regional, rather than global, scale and on selected issues rather than comprehensive policy.

- One approach is to hold government, private industry, and individual citizens responsible for cybersecurity. By strengthening every link in a network’s chain, this multistakeholder approach can be a model for governance and cybercrime prevention on both a national and global level.

  > - Expand on the idea of a multistakeholder approach to cybersecurity. What strengths does each stakeholder bring?
  > - Governments have the economic backing and legislative power to enact laws that may, in turn, influence other nations to respond in kind. Industries in the private sector understand the profit angle of cyberattacks and can add their expertise accordingly. Individual technological experts can better design protocols and best practices for companies.

## What Are the Best Types of Laws, Treaties, or Other Measures to Use?

- Many countries are working to prioritize which cyber risk issues to target through international agreements.

- One priority is how to handle attribution. While it may be impossible to track a cyberintruder’s exact identity or specific location, investigators may be able to determine the country from which the attack originated. An international agreement to hold each country accountable for its sovereign cyberterritory could be a starting point in not only providing relief to victims but also encouraging the responsible country to strengthen its internal network standards and better monitor and educate its users.

- Many officials believe that if one country establishes proven and effective laws, other countries will adopt similar laws, especially when information and frameworks are more freely shared. The private sector can serve as a resource because global companies are more accustomed to the shared and open platform needed to protect against cybercrime.

- In 2016, the European Union (EU) passed the Network and Information Security Directive, which aims to raise the cybersecurity capabilities of all member nations to the same level of effectiveness. The law is designed to encourage cooperation among member countries, establishing security requirements for certain industries and services (such as energy, transportation, banking, healthcare, and water supply and distribution) and requiring that cyberattacks be reported to the authorities.

  > - Cybersecurity laws vary greatly by country. As you think of examples, what traits stand out to you as those that help a country succeed in cybersecurity?
  > - In general, countries with successful cybersecurity laws have viable computer emergency response teams, centralized coordination and control, collaboration between public and private sectors, and adequate resources to respond to immediate threats or new concerns. Countries also have a better chance of success with their cyber efforts when they are able to minimize corruption.

- Let's take a look at some countries that have experienced varying degrees of success in tackling cyber risk issues.

## Who Will Bear the Cost of Global Cybersecurity Efforts?

- There are many different views about who should bear of the cost of cybersecurity and cyberlosses. If the internet is considered part of a country’s infrastructure, the government could have some financial responsibility for the costs of cybersecurity in the same way it would for securing utilities and bridges—or in providing help after an attack.
- Although insurers have been inconsistent in their coverage for cyber claims and have yet to standardize terminology definitions, organizations need appropriate insurance coverage for cyber risks, as well as access to prevention, detection, and remediation resources.
- Public and private organizations share the cost of both cyberlosses and cybersecurity measures. They can cost-effectively manage some of these expenses by educating employees about internet security standards, encouraging safe use of mobile phones and other devices, and proactively elevating best practices through development and implementation.

## What Are Cybersecurity Best Practices?

- Cybersecurity best practices at the government level can also be appropriate for organizations of all sizes, whether operating locally or internationally. Even a small company without any apparent engagement with other countries can become a target of foreign cybercrime if it's connected to the internet and conducts business online.
- For example, the owner of an organization in the United States may not believe that global cyber risks are a concern, but unknown to the owner, the vendor she receives tech support from has a support center set up in another country. Were she to grant a technician in that country access to her computer network, she could be victimized if the foreign network does not have the same level of security her own network does.
- These are some best practices an organization can adopt to develop a more global perspective:
  - Developing (or supporting) groups devoted to sharing information and best practices
  - Helping developing countries strengthen their local economies to decrease the appeal of cybercrime
  - Recognizing common ground and improving communication between other industry organizations in neighboring cities and states, as well as internationally
  - Investing in technology and creating new standards and procedures to promote better attribution potential
  - Encouraging integration of cyber-related activities into existing frameworks and procedures at all levels
  - Implementing ways to encourage trust and information sharing while still employing security mechanisms

## Summary

- Malicious cyber activity threatens organizations of all sizes as well as national banking, commerce, and infrastructure systems. By staying current on cyber regulations and best practices, risk professionals can help both public and private sectors manage cyber risk.
