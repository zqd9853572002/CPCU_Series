# Identifying Catalysts for an ERM Program

- Objective: Identify a catalyst for enterprise risk management in your organization.

- What do the organizations best equipped to compete in the global marketplace have in common? Regardless of size, history, or industry, they all understand that risk management isn't about just protecting the organization from harm. Instead, they see it as a unified approach to balancing strategic opportunities and threats, taking into account the upside and downside of risks arising from the business.

- This holistic approach to risk management is often referred to as enterprise risk management (ERM). When properly implemented, ERM provides substantial benefits to an organization. But what motivates an organization to initiate an ERM program?

- In most organizations, resistance to change can hinder adoption of ERM. However, a cataclysmic risk event, such as a financial crisis, or a forward-thinking management team can motivate an organization to improve its risk practices and implement a formal ERM program.

- Catalysts that motivate organizations to establish an ERM program can be classified as external or internal to the organization. Some ERM programs focus solely on the external risk environment; however, those that take a holistic approach by also focusing on the internal risk environment are usually more successful.

  >Allison Zheng on the Origins of Clorox's ERM Program
  >Back in 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, the CFO asked the VP-Global Risk Management to start an ERM program to improve risk-based decision making. So, she had immediate buy-in because there was a request from the CFO. Thereafter, we hired a consulting firm to help develop our ERM Framework and received sponsorship from the CFO and the general counsel to formally create the program. They valued the risk assessment process and wanted us to take deep dives into Clorox's various risks.

  >ERM is an evolving area, and a lot of people aren't familiar with it. Until there's broader understanding of what ERM practitioners do, soft skills such as getting alignment, buy-in, and support are key to launching a program.

## External Catalysts

- The functional and operational business environment has become increasingly complex, requiring a framework of laws, regulations, rules, and standards to manage and govern. Senior managers and boards of directors are being held to higher standards of accountability. Various stakeholders have heightened expectations of the organizations in which they are invested and are making more demands on management and requiring increased transparency.

- External ERM Catalysts

  ![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/09/BT5LdI.jpg)

- Let's examine how one of these external catalysts, violation of a law or regulation, can serve as a catalyst for establishing an ERM program.

  - The Cost of Legal Violations

    > Here a few examples of organizations whose ultimately costly violation of the law wound up making headlines:
    >
    > - Odebrecht S.A., a large construction conglomerate based in Brazil, and affiliated petrochemical company Braskem S.A. were charged with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Authorities in the U.S., Brazil, and Switzerland charged the organizations with engaging in a long-running and complex scheme to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to government officials across three continents. In 2016, Odebrecht and Braskem agreed to pay at least 3.5 billion to resolve the bribery charges.
    > - Two subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company paid 3.8 million in 2017 to settle allegations from the U.S. Department of Labor that they violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Federal investigators found that Disney Vacation Club Management Corp. and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. Inc. violated minimum wage, overtime, and record-keeping provisions of the FLSA. According to investigators, the subsidiaries failed to maintain proper payroll records and deducted a uniform expense from employees’ pay that caused some employees’ hourly rates to fall below the federal minimum wage. In addition, some employees weren’t properly compensated for performing duties during pre- and post-shift periods. Following the investigation, Department of Labor officials said these kinds of violations aren’t uncommon.
    > - The Cyberspace Administration of China fined Holdings, an internet technology conglomerate based in China, in 2017 for violating the Cyber Security Law of the People’s Republic of China by failing to monitor its online platforms for illegal content.
    >
    > [DA13187]

- Next, let's examine examples of internal catalysts that can motivate an organization to establish an ERM program.

## Internal Catalysts

- Internal catalysts for an ERM program are often driven by senior management and based on a desire to better manage an organization's strategic and financial risks.

- Internal ERM Catalysts

  - The desire to respond more thoroughly to risks threatening the organization's survival or reputation
  - The need to infuse a risk perspective in strategic planning and decisions
  - The support of efforts to reduce the overall cost of capital and optimize capital allocation by evaluating the positive and negative aspects of risk in all major decisions
  - The desire to manage volatility in financial results

- A newly appointed senior manager may motivate an organization to implement an ERM program.

  > Richard James on the Origins of Direct Rail Service's ERM Program
  >
  > Two years ago, our new managing director discovered there wasn’t a formal ERM program in place, and she presented ways to address the issue to the Board. Shortly thereafter, I was placed on secondment from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to implement an ERM program.
  >
  > [DA13246_2]

## External and Internal Catalysts Combined

- The motivation for establishing an ERM program often arises from a combination of internal and external catalysts.
- [The Origins of TruMark Financial's ERM Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJNjRo-Jv9I)
- Strategic risk can be created and affected by external factors such as economic conditions, consumer demand, and government regulations. Internal factors include an organization’s structure, culture, or processes. Because strategic risks may have far-reaching ramifications that can alter the course of an organization’s future, illustrating their importance can be an effective tool in convincing decision makers to provide resources for an ERM program.

## Organizational Resiliency

- The need to improve organizational resiliency is another motivating factor for an ERM program. One company's misfortune can imperil the companies it's connected to, making an organizational resiliency plan an essential part of every risk management toolbox.
- An organizational resiliency strategy allows companies to better withstand short-term shocks to help ensure long-term business viability. It allows organizations to quickly adapt to disruption and to restabilize by taking a flexible approach to risk, learning from successes and failures, and better predicting emerging risks via in-house reporting and collaborating on risk with vendors and customers.

## Summary

- Both internal and external catalysts can compel an organization to adopt ERM. External drivers include laws, regulatory requirements, risk management standards, credit rating agency methodologies, investor requirements, corporate social responsibility, and catastrophic events. Internal drivers include responses to risks threatening an organization's survival or reputation as well as inclusion of a risk perspective in strategic planning and financial decisions. Rather than being driven exclusively by external events, effective ERM programs are often motivated by and achieve a balance between internal and external factors.

# The Risktech Ecosystem

- Objective: Explain how risktech can be viewed as an ecosystem of technologies and objects that is transforming the way in which risks are assessed and controlled.
- Technology is ever increasing, and its effect on risk management is significant. Through technology, risk managers are better able to effectively assess and control risk by allowing people and objects to measure conditions in their environment and communicate those results to decision makers.
- Risk monitoring and mitigation technology is known as risktech. It is similar to insurtech, and many of the technologies used in both realms are identical. However, risktech goes one step beyond insurtech by expanding its focus on how to make risk financing more efficient to include how to prevent and mitigate risk in a variety of industries.
- [Risktech Ecosystem]()

## Risktech

- Risktech is largely the result of emerging technologies coupled with smart products. Their interactions generate big data, to which advanced analytics can be applied, ultimately reducing the uncertainty associated with predicting future events.

  > [Chris Mandel Talks About Risktech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtl3IGTaM5o)

- The application of emerging technologies to risk assessment and control is largely being driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of IoT objects that collect and transmit data through the internet, primarily through the use of sensors. For example, sensor data can inform a supply chain manager that weather conditions have interrupted the production of parts or that cargo has been stolen.

- Other technologies are also informing risk assessment and control. For example, virtual reality can be used to train workers in an artificial environment without the bodily injury and property damage risks present in a real-world setting. Artificial intelligence allows machines to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that require critical thinking, such as making a risk assessment decision.

- As technology evolves, the availability and sophistication of smart products that can help refine risk management techniques continue to grow. Smart products sense their environment, process data, and communicate with other smart products and smart operations.

  > [Jim Gkonos Talks About Risk Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfbQRC5lKBg)

- Can you think of some smart products being used in risk management today?

  > A variety of smart products are being used in various industries to assess and control risk. Some of the most common include wearables, drones, robots, and smartphones.

- Let’s take a look at how these smart products are being used:

  - Wearables such as helmets that monitor fatigue or wristwatches that measure vital signs can sense, monitor, report, and analyze workers’ health or well-being and their surrounding environments. Data generated by wearables may be specific to one employee or aggregated for a project, a team, or an organization.
  - Drones can be used in surveillance and aerial photography; being unmanned and highly versatile makes them ideal for assessing conditions or risks in dangerous or unfamiliar areas. The data generated by drones relies heavily on other technologies, such as computer vision, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, to mine the data collected and form conclusions about detected objects.
  - Robots can measure, respond to, and produce data for monitored hazards or changing environmental conditions. And by performing certain activities, they can reduce the frequency of human error.
  - Smartphones can measure acceleration, light, temperature, humidity, pressure, proximity, and location—all particularly relevant in transportation and workplace safety.

- Using the data provided by technologies and smart objects, businesses can practice preventive analytics. Preventive analytics leverages modern technology, big data, and advanced analytics to identify root causes and their interactions. It is particularly effective because it can continuously monitor activity—whether arising from humans or machines. By learning patterns, a machine can identify situations or behaviors that are unexpected or will likely produce an unexpected result. Therefore, preventive analytics is forward looking. Consider how computer-vision technology in an auto identifies and analyzes risks, which can then lead to preventive actions. For example, a truck’s brakes may automatically be applied because a front-facing camera determines that a vehicle has stopped directly in front of the truck.

- Check Your Understanding

  > Susanna is considering the use of emerging technologies to train new drivers of her organization’s fuel trucks. Because of the many inherent dangers on the job and the regulations that must be followed, she is especially concerned that the new employees become adequately exposed to road situations before getting behind the wheel of the fuel trucks. Explain how virtual reality could help her training efforts.
  >
  > - Virtual reality could expose the employees to various scenarios they might encounter before they begin their behind-the-wheel training, such as how much clearance they need to safely pass under bridges or how to safely change lanes. It can also simulate other scenarios, such as another vehicle swerving into the truck’s lane or coming into close proximity with a car fire, which could provide the skills needed to respond quickly to situations that may be rare but are also very serious. Susanna could work side by side with employees to acquaint them with the technology and then monitor trainees’ responses remotely, or view them later, to assess progress and suggest appropriate improvements.

## Connected Ecosystems

- A useful way to think about emerging technologies and their application to risk assessment and control is to view them as part of a connected ecosystem. An ecosystem is a system of interconnected parts, and, as we’ve discussed, the risktech ecosystem includes emerging technologies, smart products and smart operations, and big data analytics.

- However, emerging technologies and smart products also connect the physical and virtual domains, resulting in connected ecosystems for a variety of risk management specialties, including property, supply chain, transportation, catastrophe, and workplace safety.

- Overall, these connections enhance risk management decision making, as they allow property managers to detect leaks and malfunctions, transportation managers to respond to drivers’ issues in real time, more people to be evacuated before an impending catastrophe, and prevention of countless other injuries and damages.

- Connected Ecosystems

## Summary

- Risktech incorporates emerging technologies into smart products and operations. In turn, this generates data for analytics, leading to improved risk assessment and control.

# The Evolution of Risk Treatment

- Objective: Assess the evolution of the risk treatment environment based on technology.

- Risk financing, which entails transfer or retention of risk, is a form of risk treatment that is needed to pay for the cost of an organization's risks—and technology is dramatically changing the risk financing environment. Risk management professionals who understand the impact of technology on this area will be better positioned to select the most appropriate financing for their organizations’ risks.

- To achieve strategic objectives, every organization must find ways to pay for the corresponding risks and treatments. So risk financing must be part of every organization’s holistic risk management strategy.

- The more risk an organization retains to pursue opportunities, the more funds it must allocate to finance those risks. These funds are then used to apply the risk treatments of avoidance, modification, transfer, and retention.

- Technological advancements have affected all types of risk treatment, with modification and transfer being affected most. In addition, technology has spurred significant improvements in processing risk-related financial transactions.

- Because technology, and its risk management ramifications, evolves too fast for any single person to keep track of, organizations that use risk committees composed of cross-functional decision makers and stakeholders and discuss emerging risks and potential technological treatments are in a better position to take full advantage of emerging technologies.

- Let’s take a look at technology’s influence on risk modification, risk transfer, and risk-related financial transactions.

## Technology’s Impact on Risk Modification

- In the past, risk management focused on examining the causes of past losses in order to identify and implement ways to prevent future losses. Today, thanks to advances in data capture, data storage, and data analytics, risk management has become more forward-looking. Large datasets about past events gathered using computers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, wearables, and telematics devices allow organizations to accurately identify patterns of risk, model risk, and predict risk. In some cases, risk can be predicted so accurately that it can be modified to the point of being nearly preventable. This can create significant cost savings for both organizations and insurers.

  > [Preventing Risk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50ZltC5zWVg)

- The advancements in forecasting could result in minimal financing being required to retain, transfer, or modify negative risks. However, risk management professionals must factor in that there is a cost associated with forecasting technology. For example, the sensors used the by the distributor in the exhibit would have to be purchased, installed, and maintained.

## Technology’s Impact on Risk Transfer

- Risk transfer
  The shifting of risk from one individual or organization to another.
   is the area most people think of when it comes to risk financing. Typically, it involves purchasing insurance that shifts the risks associated with an organization’s product, process, or action to an insurer. Risk transfer has been significantly altered by the evolution of technology.

- Insurers' growing access to big data coupled with advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have made it easier for them to not only predict and plan for risk but also to develop products that specifically address certain risks.

  >
  > Insurance plays a big role in risk financing by facilitating the transfer of risk. Identify ways advancements in big data are changing how insurers operate.
  >
  > - Advancements in big data are changing how insurers operate by helping insurers stand in their customers’ shoes, better understand what’s driving risk, develop a risk appetite, and price insurance policies more accurately.

- These advancements have also helped insurers price insurance policies more precisely, so organizations managing risk don’t have to pay for what they don’t need. For example, insurers can now use telematics devices and sensors to monitor their customers’ behaviors and environments and then customize policies to more closely align with customers’ actual risks.

  - Insurers Embrace IoT

    ![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/09/BTIZWT.jpg)

- Technology has also facilitated insurers’ abilities to create alternative products. For example, parametric insurance and microinsurance, which cover risks associated with small events or one-time events such as a specific trip or project, are now more prevalent. In the past, the problem with these products was that they generated a relatively low premium for the administrative burden associated with them, so insurers were hesitant to offer them. But technological advancements have eased the administrative burden and expense of these products by enabling applications, data, and premiums to be collected and processed electronically.
- Using real-time data and AI, insurers can push product offers to potential customers that are specifically tailored to the requirements of those individuals or organizations when they need them - and the payment options and policy information can be delivered to a mobile device, eliminating paperwork.

## Technology’s Impact on Financial Transactions

- The faster an organization can recoup its financial losses and regain the position it was in before the loss occurred, the better. Technology is constantly speeding up this recovery process. Smart contracts and blockchain technologies are the forefront of this acceleration.

- Smart insurance contracts are self-executing contracts that will initiate a loss payment as soon as the parameters for the contract have been reached. For example, as soon as it’s verified that a manufacturing facility with flood insurance is located in an area that experienced a flood, the contract will trigger a claim payment to the facility without the need for an intermediary or third party to process the payment. This can dramatically increase the speed of loss payments, as well as reduce administrative costs for insurers.

- Blockchain technologies can be the infrastructure upon which smart contracts are built and implemented. Say, for example, your business has flood insurance and loss payments can be triggered through a smart contract on a blockchain. If the blockchain receives a signal that a flood has occurred in your area (this could come from IoT sensors or a weather service), the blockchain could instantly determine whether your business is covered for a flood loss. Having detected that your business has coverage, a loss payment could be deposited directly into your organization’s bank account. The claim, verification of coverage (claim investigation), and payment could be completed within seconds rather than days or weeks.

  > - Based on what you know about technology’s growing influence on risk financing, summarize how technology is changing, or will change, how risk is financed through insurance?
  > - Some of the ways technology will affect how risk is financed through insurance include increasing speed and automation, reducing paperwork, implementing smart (self-executing) contracts, and creating more policies that specifically address the needs of individual customers.

## Summary

- Risk financing must be a part of every organization’s holistic risk management strategy. It’s necessary to help an organization pay for the cost of the risks it takes in order to achieve its strategic goals. The risk financing environment has evolved significantly because of the influence of advancing technology, particularly for the areas of risk modification and risk transfer. In addition, technology has increased the speed with which financial transactions involving risk can be processed.

# Managing Supply Chain Risk

- Objective: Given a case, assess an organization's management and treatment of a supply chain risk.

  > Apply Your Knowledge
  >
  > [The Chipotle Case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhQArOv_nTI)
  >
  > - How do you think the digital and food-safety investments Chipotle has made in response to its past food-poisoning incidents positioned it to deal with the COVID-19 crisis?
  > - Chipotle's digital and food-safety investments have put it in a better position than many other restaurant chains to operate during and after a pandemic. Investment in digitization has made it easier to convert to more online ordering and contact-free delivery. Investment in food safety, such as microbiological testing of raw ingredients, has shown consumers that Chipotle is aware of and committed to their safety. Additionally, Chipotle has led in implementing social distancing, employee health, and air purification measures at its locations.

# Organizational Culture’s Influence

- Objective: Explain how an organization’s attitude toward risk is influenced by organizational culture.

- An organization’s culture—the shared beliefs, values, and accepted behaviors of the people and groups that compose it—often provides valuable insight into its attitude toward risk and risk management. Knowing what makes an organization tick can help you provide the best possible service, ranging from suggesting the best risk control techniques to suggesting an appropriate deductible amount. In this way, corporate culture can be a key determinant of whether its enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy will be a success.

  >
  > Allison Zheng (Program Manager, Clorox), interviewed by Mike Elliott, March 2019, transcript, The Institutes, Malvern, Pa. [DA13130]

- An organization’s culture, or lack thereof, becomes evident in the way it treats its employees and customers, the manner in which information is shared, and the depth of its decision-making process. Because culture can seep into just about everything an organization does, whether it has a conservative or an aggressive approach to taking risks, it will influence the organization's risk management process as well. For example, an organization that prides itself on being on the bleeding edge of technology will have a culture that encourages risk-taking. This will affect its risk outlook, whether by influencing investments made to ensure solvency in case new products fail or by acquiring insurance coverage for potentially risky manufacturing techniques.

- > What Do You Know?
  >
  > Organizational culture is not one monolithic characteristic, but rather a collection of several factors. Try to name three bases that form organizational culture.
  >
  > - These are the bases of organizational culture:
  >   - Beliefs—The practices and concepts that employees accept as true. Assumptions formed from these beliefs ultimately drive behavior.
  >   - Values—These are exhibited through the organization’s goals and how it pursues them.
  >   - Behaviors—These are determined by organizational values. The organization’s employees establish and expect all staff to exhibit a certain norm or standard of behavior based on values and assumptions.

## Types of Organizational Culture

- An organization’s culture—its norms and attitudes—is reflected in written and unwritten rules, its formal code of conduct, and the actual code of conduct as exhibited in daily decisions and behaviors.
- Although an organization's culture can often be guided by its mission statement, it must also be developed and nurtured within the organization. A fully developed organizational culture creates a sense of shared meaning and experiences among employees that help guide decision making. In essence, organizational culture is the glue that binds the organization into a cohesive unit.
- Bases of Organizational Culture
  - There are three bases of organizational culture:
    - Beliefs are the practices and concepts that employees accept as true. Assumptions formed from these beliefs ultimately drive behavior.
    - Values are exhibited through the organization’s goals and the manner in which the organization pursues its goals.
    - Behavior is determined by organizational values. The organization’s employees establish and expect all staff to exhibit a certain norm or standard of behavior based on values and assumptions.

- An organization’s corporate culture can vary based on the beliefs, values, and behaviors that are considered norms, which themselves can vary based on geographic location, political environment, social characteristics, and so forth. Further, an organization’s culture isn’t always monolithic—one organization can have several forms of culture depending on circumstances.

- For example, an organization’s home office located on Wall Street may have a culture that requires employees to wear formal business attire at all times, while its satellite office in Newport Beach, California, allows its employees to dress in t-shirts and jeans. Job functions and geographic locations are just two of the many factors that can lead to the creation of subcultures.

- The Four Types of Corporate Culture

  - Hierarchy—Decision-making authority is well defined; rules and procedures are standardized.

  - Market—The organization is more concerned with outward relationships; primary objectives are profitability, bottom-line results, strength in market niches, stretch targets, and secure customer bases.

  - Clan—The organization is seen as a family. Teamwork is emphasized, and workers are encouraged to voice suggestions on how to improve processes.

  - Adhocracy—Adaptability is key; authority does not rest with one party, but rather moves from individual to individual or team to team as needed.

[DA12955]

## Organizational Culture and Risk Attitude

- While there are many possible risk attitudes, those that insurance professionals encounter generally fall into these three categories:

  |                                |                                                              |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Risk seeking (risk naive)      | Individuals with a risk-seeking, or risk-naive, attitude may believe that the result of their risk decision, which is based on a short-term horizon, will allow the organization to reap significant rewards worth the risk (both upside and downside). |
  | Risk avoiding (risk obsessed)  | Individuals with this attitude focus on the negative side of potential risks. They seek methods of transferring risk to another entity to avoid it altogether, and they prefer to continue traditional methods of business operations rather than to innovate. |
  | Risk optimizing (risk managed) | Aggressive and conservative tendencies are balanced in this risk attitude. Individuals with risk-optimizing attitudes assess risk based on an organization’s vision, mission, goals, values, and beliefs, and realistically evaluate potential outcomes and consequences. |

- An organization’s approach to risk should be a part of a dynamic continuum between risk avoiding and risk seeking on which the point of risk optimization will shift as the organization’s risk portfolio changes or evolves. For example, the risk attitude of a financial services company specializing in derivatives might fall closer to the risk-seeking extreme than a savings institution’s, which would fall closer to the risk-avoiding extreme.

- Risk attitudes, however, are not always consistent throughout an organization. An organization’s executive board and high-level management may have a much greater tolerance for risk and variance of results than low-level managers and individual employees. If the chief executive officer (CEO) suggests a marketing campaign that does little to improve sales, the failure is more likely to be overlooked than if an employee in the Marketing Department suggested the campaign.

- Organizational culture also plays a role in where an organization falls on the risk attitude continuum. An organization with a conservative, unchanging culture is more likely to practice risk avoidance, while an organization with an adaptive, innovative culture is more likely to practice risk-seeking behaviors. An organization that seeks to optimize its risks must have a strong risk-aware culture—one that encourages and supports identification, assessment, and communication of potential risks and rewards as part of its decision-making process.

  > Positive and Negative Cultural Drivers
  >
  > ![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/09/BTIrkt.jpg)

- Sometimes, there can be culture-related pushback when a risk management process is implemented in an organization. For a risk-aware culture to be fully established, any new behaviors that have to be put into practice to support it must become accepted norms. Without newly established norms, the risk management process that is dependent on these new norms will begin to degrade as senior management turns its attention to other projects and workers return to old habits. Actions, rather than words, drive corporate culture, and if management shows a general disregard for risk management, that can seep into all areas of an organization’s operation.

  > The Role of Organizational Culture in the Macondo Well Explosion
  >
  > - On April 20, 2010, an explosion on a deep-sea oil-drilling rig operated by British Petroleum (BP) in the Macondo Prospect of the Gulf of Mexico killed eleven workers and released 4.9 million barrels of oil into the gulf before the well was capped three months later.
  > - After investigating the disaster, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling reported the most significant cause was “an overarching failure of management” in the areas of leadership, communication, procedures, training and supervision, contractor management and oversight, technology use, and risk analysis.
  > - The Commission reported that although BP and its contractors, Transocean and Halliburton, had corporate policies that emphasized the importance of management areas such as communication, leadership, training, and safety, “the fact that failures in these areas led to the Macondo blowout . . . . underscores the importance of management follow-through to ensure that policies affect cultures and day-to-day routines.”
  > - In short, the organizations’ management failed to instill in their cultures any recognition of the value of established safety policies and procedures. Firmly embedded in those same cultures, however, was an overriding sense of urgency to bring new wells on line without delay or costly complications. This contributed to a risk-seeking culture among the Macondo well-site workers and their managers that supported snap decision-making without supporting evidence, abandonment of procedural safeguards, and ignoring of obvious safety-check warnings, among other behaviors.

## Check Your Understanding

- Springer’s Attire, a vintage clothing shop, is co-owned by Benjamin and Carolina. Since opening five years ago, the store has gained a dedicated client base and created a formidable online presence via social media. Although profitable, the store hasn’t yet brought in enough profit to justify expanding the staff or opening a new location.
- Benjamin thinks they could capitalize on the store’s popularity by taking out a loan to open a new location and to expand its online presence to include an online store. He believes that a second location could provide enough income to support itself relatively quickly, and then the property could be leveraged to fund a third location, and so on.
- Carolina, however, thinks it would be better to maintain a policy of slow growth, only expanding after the store has enough liquidity to afford to do so without taking out loans. She’s concerned that a failure of the store to develop sales at a new location or through an internet store could hurt the solvency of their primary location and, in effect, hurt the business. Identify what category of risk attitude each co-owner might fall into, and explain why.
- Check Answer
  - Benjamin’s risk attitude can be best described as risk seeking, or risk naive. He assumes the second store will be a success and does not consider the hard work that would be required to open a new location. He also assumes the store’s social media following will automatically translate into sales through an online store when, in fact, followers may just like to view what the store offers.
  - Carolina’s risk attitude can be described as risk avoiding, or risk obsessed. She’s focusing on the worst possible outcomes of attempting to expand their business and prefers to keep things as they are because she and Benjamin know they work.
