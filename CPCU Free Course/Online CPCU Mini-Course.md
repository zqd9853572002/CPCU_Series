# The Risktech Ecosystem

- Objective: Explain how risktech can be viewed as an ecosystem of technologies and objects that is transforming the way in which risks are assessed and controlled.

- Technology is ever increasing, and its effect on risk management is significant. Through technology, risk managers are better able to effectively assess and control risk by allowing people and objects to measure conditions in their environment and communicate those results to decision makers.

- Risk monitoring and mitigation technology is known as risktech. It is similar to insurtech, and many of the technologies used in both realms are identical. However, risktech goes one step beyond insurtech by expanding its focus on how to make risk financing more efficient to include how to prevent and mitigate risk in a variety of industries.

## Risktech

- Risktech is largely the result of emerging technologies coupled with smart products. Their interactions generate big data, to which advanced analytics can be applied, ultimately reducing the uncertainty associated with predicting future events.

- The application of emerging technologies to risk assessment and control is largely being driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of IoT objects that collect and transmit data through the internet, primarily through the use of sensors. For example, sensor data can inform a supply chain manager that weather conditions have interrupted the production of parts or that cargo has been stolen.

- Other technologies are also informing risk assessment and control. For example, virtual reality can be used to train workers in an artificial environment without the bodily injury and property damage risks present in a real-world setting. Artificial intelligence allows machines to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that require critical thinking, such as making a risk assessment decision.

- As technology evolves, the availability and sophistication of smart products that can help refine risk management techniques continue to grow. Smart products sense their environment, process data, and communicate with other smart products and smart operations.

  > - Can you think of some smart products being used in risk management today?
  > - A variety of smart products are being used in various industries to assess and control risk. Some of the most common include wearables, drones, robots, and smartphones.

- Let’s take a look at how these smart products are being used:

  - Wearables such as helmets that monitor fatigue or wristwatches that measure vital signs can sense, monitor, report, and analyze workers’ health or well-being and their surrounding environments. Data generated by wearables may be specific to one employee or aggregated for a project, a team, or an organization.
  - Drones can be used in surveillance and aerial photography; being unmanned and highly versatile makes them ideal for assessing conditions or risks in dangerous or unfamiliar areas. The data generated by drones relies heavily on other technologies, such as computer vision, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, to mine the data collected and form conclusions about detected objects.
  - Robots can measure, respond to, and produce data for monitored hazards or changing environmental conditions. And by performing certain activities, they can reduce the frequency of human error.
  - Smartphones can measure acceleration, light, temperature, humidity, pressure, proximity, and location—all particularly relevant in transportation and workplace safety.

- Using the data provided by technologies and smart objects, businesses can practice preventive analytics. Preventive analytics leverages modern technology, big data, and advanced analytics to identify root causes and their interactions. It is particularly effective because it can continuously monitor activity—whether arising from humans or machines. By learning patterns, a machine can identify situations or behaviors that are unexpected or will likely produce an unexpected result. Therefore, preventive analytics is forward looking. Consider how computer-vision technology in an auto identifies and analyzes risks, which can then lead to preventive actions. For example, a truck’s brakes may automatically be applied because a front-facing camera determines that a vehicle has stopped directly in front of the truck.

- Check Your Understanding
  - Susanna is considering the use of emerging technologies to train new drivers of her organization’s fuel trucks. Because of the many inherent dangers on the job and the regulations that must be followed, she is especially concerned that the new employees become adequately exposed to road situations before getting behind the wheel of the fuel trucks. Explain how virtual reality could help her training efforts.
  - Virtual reality could expose the employees to various scenarios they might encounter before they begin their behind-the-wheel training, such as how much clearance they need to safely pass under bridges or how to safely change lanes. It can also simulate other scenarios, such as another vehicle swerving into the truck’s lane or coming into close proximity with a car fire, which could provide the skills needed to respond quickly to situations that may be rare but are also very serious. Susanna could work side by side with employees to acquaint them with the technology and then monitor trainees’ responses remotely, or view them later, to assess progress and suggest appropriate improvements.

## Connected Ecosystems

- A useful way to think about emerging technologies and their application to risk assessment and control is to view them as part of a connected ecosystem. An ecosystem is a system of interconnected parts, and, as we’ve discussed, the risktech ecosystem includes emerging technologies, smart products and smart operations, and big data analytics.
- However, emerging technologies and smart products also connect the physical and virtual domains, resulting in connected ecosystems for a variety of risk management specialties, including property, supply chain, transportation, catastrophe, and workplace safety.
- Overall, these connections enhance risk management decision making, as they allow property managers to detect leaks and malfunctions, transportation managers to respond to drivers’ issues in real time, more people to be evacuated before an impending catastrophe, and prevention of countless other injuries and damages.

## Summary

- Risktech incorporates emerging technologies into smart products and operations. In turn, this generates data for analytics, leading to improved risk assessment and control.

# Understanding How Insurers Operate

[Understanding How Insurers Operate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVZ743XDtKs)

# Insurer Goals and Constraints

- Objective: Evaluate a typical insurer’s top five goals and how constraints can prevent insurers from achieving those goals.

- To help an insurer operate successfully, insurance professionals must understand the goals of the organization and navigate the constraints that can obstruct it from achieving those goals.

- Like any other business, insurers operate with specific goals in mind—but they also often face constraints that many industries do not have. These constraints can originate from an insurer's internal operation as well as its external environment.

  > What Do You Know?
  >
  > - Miguel is a customer service representative at a small insurer. The company, through its employee benefit plans, makes significant financial contributions toward Miguel's health insurance, retirement savings, life insurance, and disability insurance. By making these contributions, what major goal is the insurer trying to achieve?
  > - The insurer is trying to fulfill its duty to society. The duty to society is one of the five major goals many insurers share. Achieving this goal often involves helping other organizations and maintaining a qualified workforce.

## Insurer Goals

- Insurers generally share five top goals. Let's discuss each one.

  [Major Goals of Insurers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVqdG_xCFzo)

### Earn a Profit

- The profit goal is most commonly associated with proprietary insurers. Cooperative insurers also aim to earn a profit, but it's not their primary goal.
- Insurers earn money by charging insureds a premium for an insurance contract (or policy). To pay for losses covered under the contract and to fulfill regulatory requirements, insurers take a portion of their surplus, or premiums not immediately needed to pay operating expenses, and invest in stock, bonds, and real estate. Ideally, these investments produce income in the form of interest, dividends, and investment gains. This income can be further invested to pay future covered losses, expand the insurer's operations, or be returned to the insurer's investors.
- A proprietary insurer must earn a profit to provide stockholders with a return on investment. This is important because a proprietary insurer can only attract capital investors if its profits are comparable to or better than similar insurers. If investors don't believe that they'll receive an acceptable rate of return, they'll invest elsewhere.
- For cooperative insurers, one source of capital is funds from policyholders, usually in the form of premiums. Surplus from underwriting operations is another. Profits are returned to policyholders in the form of dividends or are contributed to surplus to help ensure solvency and protect against catastrophic losses. Under certain circumstances, a cooperative insurer can obtain additional capital by issuing surplus notes. Because these notes are usually repaid only from profits, gaining capital from them often depends on the insurer’s anticipated profitability.
- Whether cooperative or proprietary, an insurer can increase premium volume by selling more policies. And when an insurer's underwriting operation effectively evaluates risks and appropriately prices insurance products, premium volume and profits increase.

### Meet Customer Needs

- To attract customers, an insurer must provide products and services customers seek at a competitive price. Insurance customers also expect prompt, professional service. When insureds suffer a loss, they can be upset or stressed. Consequently, the insurer must provide quick, meaningful assistance—which requires well-trained, customer-focused personnel and automated support systems.
- Meeting customers’ needs, however, may conflict with the profit goal in the short term. In some cases, offering high-quality insurance at an attractive price may not generate the profit that the insurer needs to obtain and retain capital. Providing training, operating automated call centers, and staying up to date with technology can also be costly and conflict with achieving the profit goal in the near term. But the long-term benefits of these expenditures can reduce costs and premiums, and the improved customer service can boost policy retention and new business.

### Comply With Legal Requirements

- An insurer must comply with laws and regulations to be considered a responsible corporate citizen and maintain a strong reputation. Legal compliance can enhance the ability to attract capital and customers. Conversely, lack of compliance may lead to fines, penalties, and a decrease in business.
- Compliance with state regulations is one of an insurer’s greatest responsibilities. Unfortunately, compliance comes with expenses for filings, record keeping, accounting, and legal activities. Participating in assigned risk plans, Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans, and government-required insolvency funds also increases expenses. When these expenses increase the cost of insurance, they create a conflict between the profit and customer needs goals.

### Diversify Risk

- Diversifying risk is a goal for property-casualty insurers because of the potential for catastrophic losses. By spreading risk over a wider geographic area and multiple types of insurance business, insurers can help protect themselves from catastrophic losses. This goal complements the insurer's goals of earning a profit and fulfilling its duty to society.

  > Consider an insurer with a high concentration of policies along the coast of Florida. A single event, such as a hurricane, could result in staggering losses for the insurer to cover. However, if the insurer spreads its risk over a wider geographic area by issuing policies farther inland or in a different region of the country, a hurricane along the Florida coast would have less effect on the insurer's profitability.

### Fulfill Duty to Society

- An insurer has an obligation to fulfill a duty to society. At a minimum, this duty demands that the insurer avoid causing public harm. As responsible corporate citizens, many insurers go well beyond that minimum.

- Insurers often contribute funds to and support their employees' volunteer work with public service organizations. And many establish employee benefit plans that support the welfare of their employees.

  > Benefits such as medical insurance, disability insurance, retirement plans, employee assistance programs, and numerous others help employees and retirees meet their needs and minimize their use of public resources. Insurers' participation in philanthropic activities and employee benefits improves employees' job satisfaction and emotional well-being. In addition, these activities help attract qualified candidates and improve employee retention.

- While fulfilling their duty to society through philanthropic activities and employee benefit programs, insurers strive to maintain a well-qualified, knowledgeable staff, which promotes the profit and customer needs goals. However, the required use of funds for such programs competes with these goals, so insurers must strike an appropriate balance.

## Constraints on Achieving Insurer Goals

- An insurer’s path to achieving its goals isn't always clear, as several internal and external constraints might serve as obstacles.

### Internal Constraints

- While some internal constraints are universal, others are imposed only in certain circumstances or on certain types of insurers:

#### Inefficiency

- Inefficient insurers are at a disadvantage when competing with efficient ones. Inefficiencies can prevent insurers from meeting profit and service goals—which can lead to an inability to meet humanitarian or societal goals. Inefficiencies can also prevent insurers from meeting customers’ needs and, in extreme cases, can lead to insolvency and a failure to meet legal and regulatory goals. Lack of efficiency may be caused by a number of factors, such as poor management, insufficient capital, outdated technology, and an inability to adapt to change.

#### Lack of expertise

- Considerable expertise is required to successfully operate an insurer. This is particularly true for insurers in niche or specialty markets. Lack of expertise may prevent an insurer from making a profit or meeting customers’ needs or any of its goals. In extreme cases, lack of expertise could ultimately lead to insolvency.

#### Size

- A small insurer may have fewer resources than a large insurer. Large insurers can also usually invest more in market research and product development than small insurers. One advantage for a small insurer is that it can be more nimble, allowing it to respond quickly to emerging trends or changes in the marketplace.

#### Financial resources

- Insufficient financial resources can pose a serious threat to an insurer. When financial resources become strained, insurers are unable to effectively train staff, make new capital investments, or reach new markets.

#### Other internal constraints

- Examples of other internal constraints include lack of name or brand recognition and a damaged reputation. A newly established insurer might lack the name recognition necessary to achieve its profit goals even if it has the expertise and financial resources to do so. Also, if an insurer had past ethical or financial problems, overcoming its poor reputation will require time and effort to regain customer and public confidence. An insurer that fails to address all internal constraints could have problems retaining and hiring high-caliber employees.

### External Constraints

- Insurers also contend with several external constraints:

#### Regulation

- Insurance operations are closely regulated, extending from incorporation to liquidation and encompassing most activities in between. Insurance regulators monitor insurers’ solvency to protect policyholders and the public. Insurance regulation is complex, extensive, and variable by state. Products that can be offered in one state may not be approved for use in another state. The variations in property-casualty laws in different states require a broad range of staff expertise. Federal regulation adds another layer of complexity. Consequently, regulation imposes a major constraint on insurers, requiring significant resources that can inhibit the insurer’s ability to achieve its profit goals.

#### Rating agencies

- Financial rating agencies, such as A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's, rate insurers based on financial strength—which indicates insurers' abilities to meet their obligations to policyholders. To help their ratings, insurers typically strive to maintain capitalization levels in excess of the minimum amounts required. Insurers try to maintain or improve a favorable rating because a strong financial rating attracts and retains customers; however, this practice could also constrain insurers from meeting their profit goals.

#### Public opinion

- Public opinion about the insurance industry as a whole can inhibit individual insurers from meeting goals. While many customers are satisfied with their insurers, high-profile ethical issues can lead to a negative perception of the insurance industry overall. Therefore, efforts to manage reputation should include training staff in ethical decision making. Managing expenses to repair or protect an insurer's image or the image of the industry conflicts with the profit goal but helps attain the customer needs goal.

#### Competition

- Competition in the insurance industry is driven by the number of insurers in the marketplace, technological advancements, and customers seeking innovative products. Pricing and availability of insurance products fluctuate based on the amount of capital available to the industry. Although the number of property-casualty insurers has decreased because of mergers and acquisitions, competition remains high. Technology fuels competition by allowing insurers to compete for customers through personalized marketing, social media, and other digital interfaces.

#### Economic conditions

- Insurers’ investment operations can be affected by economic downturns, potentially causing investment income to fall and thereby limiting insurers’ financial resources. Inflation can also affect insurers by increasing the cost of medical, construction, and other loss-related costs.

### Check Your Understanding

> An insurer develops a new type of policy designed specifically for the construction industry, a market segment in which the insurer has little experience. No other insurer offers a policy quite like it. Management is eager to market this product, which it's sure will increase the insurer's business and profits. Identify some of the constraints that are likely to impede the insurer's ability to sell this new product right away.
>
> - Some constraints are likely to be a lack of expertise regarding the construction industry, a lack of name or brand recognition among organizations within the industry, an inability to immediately get the policy and pricing approved by regulators, and the insurer's financial strength rating (particularly, if it's rated poorly by a rating agency).

## Summary

- Generally, insurers' goals are to earn a profit, meet customer needs, comply with legal requirements, diversify risk, and fulfill a duty to society. However, internal and external constraints can obstruct insurers from meeting these goals. An insurer's success depends on its ability to navigate these constraints while generating a profit, maintaining its reputation, and abiding by laws and regulations.

# Corporations: Mergers, Dissolution, and Reorganization

- Objective: Analyze how merger, dissolution, or reorganization can terminate a corporation.

- In 1896, there were 12 corporations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, including General Electric and U.S. Leather. Today, General Electric remains an independent corporation; in contrast, U.S. Leather was dissolved in 1911. Some of the others were acquired, were broken up, or merged with other companies. A corporation may be conceived to last indefinitely, but some specific actions can terminate it.

- Just as the manner in which corporations (including insurers) form and operate can have insurance ramifications, so, too, does the manner in which they can end.

- Why Corporations Cease to Exist

  ![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/09/BTO6yV.jpg)

## Merger

- In a corporate merger, two or more corporations join together to become a new, single corporation. The new corporation owns all the assets and is subject to all the liabilities of the merging corporations. A true merger is considered a friendly transaction to which the boards of both (or all) merging organizations agree.

- Before a merger, the board of directors of each corporate party to the merger must adopt a plan of merger. The stockholders of the disappearing corporations (those corporations that will be dissolved as a result of the merger) must approve the merger plan, but the stockholders of the new (or acquiring) corporation are required to approve the plan only if the number of voting or participating (sharing in corporate profits) shares increases substantially.

- Stockholders are entitled to dissent to a merger, a share exchange, or the sale of all or substantially all of a corporation’s assets that does not occur in the usual course of business. They are also entitled to an appraisal and to receive fair value for their shares in any merger that requires shareholder approval. If a stockholder files a written dissent to a merger before or during the stockholders’ meeting, he or she must receive a written notice after the action giving rise to dissenters' rights that provides a time period and procedure to file a buyout demand.

- A corporation that owns at least 90 percent of another corporation’s stock may merge that subsidiary corporation into itself without stockholder approval. The corporation need only send the merger plan to the subsidiary’s stockholders. Many insurance corporation statutes require 95 percent, rather than 90 percent, ownership of a subsidiary before such a merger can occur, along with approval from the state department of insurance.

- Most states’ insurance company merger laws mimic general corporation laws. However, there are also significant differences between insurance company mergers and general corporation mergers:

  - Regulated corporations, such as insurance companies, can engage in only one type of business; insurers can merge only with companies in the same business.

  - State departments of insurance must approve insurance company mergers.

    >- Sometimes, corporations with diverse interests wish to purchase controlling interests in insurance companies for investment purposes. Corporations that purchase controlling interests in other corporations are called holding companies. Merger laws do not apply in these situations because the insurance companies continue as separate corporations. Instead, every state and the District of Columbia have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act. The model act includes requirements that insurer subsidiaries file information with the state department of insurance relating to capital structure, ownership, financial condition, and general business operation. The act also limits dividend payments by insurance subsidiaries to holding companies.
    >- Under the act, persons wishing to acquire control of, or merge with, an insurer are required to file a specific form (Form A, Statement Regarding the Acquisition of Control of or Merger with a Domestic Insurer), which is analyzed by the state to determine whether to approve or disapprove the transaction. The filed form is also shared with other states.

### Share Exchange and De Facto Mergers

- In a share exchange merger, a corporation acquires all of another corporation’s outstanding shares in return for shares of the acquiring corporation. A share exchange plan must be adopted by the board of directors of the disappearing corporation and approved by that corporation's stockholders, but it does not have to be approved by the stockholders of the acquiring corporation.

- In another form of merger, a corporation sells all or most of its assets to another corporation in return for the purchasing corporation’s shares, for distribution to its stockholders. In this way, two organizations are merged, but not necessarily in accordance with the statutory requirements for a merger. This transaction is known as a de facto merger—a merger in fact, if not in law.

- Under the American Bar Association Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), which is widely adopted by individual states, a sale of all or substantially all of a corporation’s assets not in the usual course of business requires stockholders’ approval through a statutory merger or consolidation.

- Corporate Mergers

  ![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/09/BTOLwD.jpg)

- When a de facto merger meets the structural changes of a statutory merger, the new corporation assumes the liabilities of the predecessor organizations. Courts will not necessarily find the new organization responsible for the liabilities of the acquired corporation if the successor organization is not a continuation of the prior business.

### Takeovers and Tender Offers

- One corporation may wish to gain control of another corporation for various business purposes, such as an increase in market share or acquisition of assets. A corporation may use various methods to achieve a takeover of another corporation.
- When one corporation wants to control or acquire another corporation against the will of that corporation’s board, the acquiring company can attempt a hostile takeover. Often, a hostile takeover attempt subsequently becomes a friendly takeover when the terms offered by the acquiring corporation improve or the acquiring corporation gains the endorsement of the target corporation’s board.
- One corporation can gain control over another by bypassing the target corporation’s board and acquiring sufficient proxies from the target corporation’s stockholders to elect its own board of directors or to vote for a merger. United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations govern proxy solicitation in these situations.
- Another method a corporation may use to acquire a corporation that is unwilling to merge is purchasing sufficient shares of the target corporation to become eligible to vote on its board of directors. To purchase shares, the prospective acquirer will make a tender offer. Federal law requires mandatory disclosure of certain information in a tender offer. Any person or group that acquires, or intends to acquire, more than 5 percent ownership of a class of securities registered with the SEC must file a statement with the SEC and send a copy of the statement to each offeree and to the issuing company. This information enables stockholders to make an informed decision about whether to sell their shares in the target company.
- Check Your Understanding
  - A media conglomerate struggling to survive in the digital era wants to merge with a content provider that boasts a substantial online presence. The content provider, however, is wary of the conglomerate's association with traditional media and does not wish to merge. Explain how the conglomerate could take over the content provider anyway.
  - When one corporation wants to control or acquire another corporation against the will of that corporation’s board, the acquiring company can attempt a hostile takeover. Often, a hostile takeover attempt subsequently becomes a friendly takeover when the terms offered by the acquiring corporation improve or the acquiring corporation gains the endorsement of the target corporation’s board. One corporation can gain control over another by bypassing the target corporation’s board and acquiring sufficient proxies from the target corporation’s stockholders to elect its own board of directors or to vote for a merger. Another method a corporation may use to acquire a corporation that is unwilling to merge is purchasing sufficient shares of the target corporation to become eligible to vote on its board of directors.

## Dissolution

- Dissolution, or termination, of a corporation can be either voluntary or involuntary. Each method follows a different procedure and has different repercussions for the parties involved.
- Voluntary corporate dissolution begins with a board resolution to dissolve the corporation, approved by a majority of the stockholders. The corporation must also file a formal statement of intent to dissolve with the state. The corporation then proceeds with liquidation, for which it can request court supervision, if necessary.
- Involuntary dissolution occurs when the state of incorporation, the stockholders, or corporate creditors file for involuntary dissolution proceedings. State proceedings are unusual and occur only in cases of gross abuse of the corporate privilege or fraudulent acquisition of the articles of incorporation. A state might hold such a proceeding when a corporation has allegedly defrauded the public repeatedly.
- Stockholders can ask a court for involuntary dissolution on the basis of the right to protect stockholders. The court can then order liquidation of corporation assets and distribution of the proceeds, after payment of debts, to the stockholders. The RMBCA provides that stockholders can file suits to dissolve the corporation on these grounds
  - The directors are deadlocked, the stockholders cannot break the deadlock, and irreparable injury to the corporation either has occurred or might occur.
  - The directors’ or officers’ acts are illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent.
  - The stockholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed to elect directors for two successive meetings.
  - The corporate assets are being wasted or misapplied.
- If a judgment for a creditor’s claim is unsatisfied, or the corporation admits insolvency in writing, the creditor can sue for dissolution of the corporation. The corporation need not be bankrupt, with its liabilities exceeding its assets. Insolvency means only that the current liabilities (as opposed to total liabilities) exceed current assets. Thus, a corporation that cannot meet its current obligations is insolvent, even though its total liabilities are less than its total assets.
- Because of the public interest in an insurance company’s ability to pay its claims, courts designate the state department of insurance as the receiver in the insurer dissolution process known as receivership.

## Reorganization

- Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, a corporation may be placed under federal bankruptcy court supervision for reorganization purposes. Chapter 11 proceedings may be voluntary or involuntary and may end in either a restructured organization or termination through bankruptcy liquidation.
- Chapter 11 filings are the most common way for corporations to restructure debt. Corporations will typically restructure by changing the ownership or operational structure of the organization in order to be more profitable. Under Chapter 11, the bankruptcy court must appoint a committee of creditors and also might appoint a committee of stockholders to work under its supervision. The court can permit the current managers to continue controlling the business and may appoint an examiner to investigate and monitor the reorganization. The court can appoint a case trustee, separate from the U.S. Trustee, to take control of the business if it finds management guilty of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, or gross mismanagement, or if it finds that the appointment of a trustee is in the best interests of the creditors, stockholders, or other persons.
- In the absence of a satisfactory reorganization or other plan, the bankruptcy court may convert the case to a regular bankruptcy liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy laws.

## Summary

- In a corporate merger, two or more corporations join to become a new, single corporation. Companies may merge for a variety of reasons, but they typically do so to form a more competitive or efficient organization. Dissolution occurs when a corporation is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and ceases to do business. Reorganization occurs when a corporation becomes bankrupt. Reorganization may result in a restructured corporation or in the complete dissolution of the corporation because of bankruptcy.

# Rate of Return on an Investment

- Objective: Given the future value of a sum over a period of time, calculate an organization's annual rate of return on an investment.

- The expected rate of return lets investors know how much they can expect their investment to grow over a certain amount of time. If a risk management or an insurance professional can determine the expected rate of return (in terms of loss reduction and prevention) on an investment in a risk control measure, he or she can better compare that with the opportunity cost of not making an alternative investment with the same funds and make a recommendation between the two.

- By knowing the future value of a sum invested today, an organization can determine whether the investment meets the organization’s required rate of return.

  > What Do You Know?
  >
  > - How does the present value formula express the relationship between the present value, future value, and the expected rate of return?
  > - The relationship between an invested sum’s present value ( PV), future value ( FV), and the expected rate of return ( r) on the investment may be expressed as PV = FV_n ÷ (1 + r)^n.

- For example, assume the business is considering an investment of 10,000 that will grow to 18,000 in eight years. The business requires a 7 percent annual rate of return on its investments.

- The present value calculation will help the business determine whether this investment meets its rate of return requirements. To set up the calculation, the sum of 10,000 is identified as the present value (PV), and the sum of 18,000 is identified as the future value (FV). Although we don't yet know the rate of return, we do know that the period of time in question is eight years, so we can plug eight into the equation in the place of n.

  ![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/09/BTj6VU.jpg)

- In this instance, the investment would meet the business's requirements because it provides an annual rate of return of 7.62 percent. Now let's see how this can be done with a financial calculator.

  [Calculating Annual Rate of Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzkb7q1YTA)

- In addition to financial calculators, computer spreadsheet programs may be used to determine these values.

- Apply Your Knowledge

  - Assume an investment of 30,000 today is expected to mature in 10 years with a value of 59,010. What is the annual rate of return ( r) that will be earned on this investment?

  - Using the present value formula, the annual rate of return would be calculated as follows:

    $PV = FV_n ÷ (1 + r)^n$

    $30,000 = 59,010 ÷ (1 + r)^{10}$

    $(1 + r) ^{10}= 59,010 ÷ 30,000$

    r = 7.0
