Objective</p><p>
Explain how the surplus lines market is facilitated by each of these:</p><ul><li>
Surplus lines laws</li><li>
Freedom from form and rate filing requirements</li><li>
The surplus lines distribution system </li><li>
Surplus lines insurers </li><li>
Surplus lines insurance products</li></ul></div></div><p>
The purpose of the surplus lines market is to provide insurance protection for distressed, unique, high-capacity, and new risks that cannot obtain coverage in the standard market. The surplus lines market functions effectively in the United States because it is supported by surplus lines laws in all states and because of attributes of the market itself.</p><p>
Several factors allow the U.S. surplus lines market to accomplish its purpose:</p><ul><li>
Surplus lines laws</li><li>
Freedom from form and rate filing requirements</li><li>
The surplus lines distribution system </li><li>
Surplus lines insurers </li><li>
Surplus lines insurance products</li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Surplus Lines Laws</h1></div><p><span>
The first property insurance company in Colonial America was the Philadelphia Contributionship, which began operations in 1752. </span><span>
Although individual states enacted insurance laws before 1800, it was not until the mid- to late 1800s that the growing industry began to be actively regulated. States licensed insurers and, to protect the insurance-buying public, regulators worked to prevent unlicensed insurers from underwriting risks in their jurisdictions. </span></p><p><span>
Unfortunately, licensed insurers were not always able to meet the public&rsquo;s insurance needs. Unlicensed insurers, primarily Lloyd&rsquo;s, continued to underwrite risks that were unacceptable to licensed insurers. </span><span>
Eventually, insurance regulators recognized the importance of a supplementary market and enacted <a data-original-title="
A state law that permits any producer with a surplus lines license issued by that state to procure insurance from an eligible surplus lines insurer if the applicant cannot obtain the desired type of insurance in the admitted market." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
surplus lines laws</a>, the first of which was passed in 1890 in New York. Although regulators continued to debate the need for the <a data-original-title="
The distribution system of surplus lines insurers and intermediaries that provides insurance on risks for which insurance is not available from admitted insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
surplus lines market</a>, it has proved to be essential.</span></p><p><span>
Obtaining insurance from a surplus lines insurer is commonly referred to as &ldquo;exporting&rdquo; a risk to the surplus lines market. Surplus lines laws do not regulate the insurers to which risks are exported, because those insurers are not within the state&rsquo;s jurisdiction or subject to its authority. </span><span>
Instead, surplus lines laws require licensing of the intermediaries that export risks to surplus lines insurers. When licensed in the insured&rsquo;s home state, surplus lines intermediaries are commonly called &ldquo;surplus lines licensees&rdquo; or &ldquo;surplus lines brokers.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span>
Surplus lines laws normally specify a diligent search requirement. The retail agent or broker must make certain that admitted insurers have had the opportunity to write the coverage before a risk can be exported to the surplus lines market. </span><span>
Following procedures set by each state, the surplus lines licensee must document that a diligent search has been conducted for an admitted insurer. After placing insurance with a surplus lines insurer, the surplus lines licensee is responsible for collecting the surplus lines premium tax stipulated in the surplus lines law and remitting the tax to the state.</span></p><p>
Because insurance is almost always unavailable in the admitted market for certain types of risks, some states have established an <a data-original-title="
A list of coverages or classes of business that can be &ldquo;exported&rdquo; (written in the surplus lines market) without fulfilling the diligent search requirement. " data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
export list</a>. An export list simplifies surplus lines placements that involve coverage generally not provided by admitted insurers. State regulators periodically review and update these lists to reflect changes in market conditions.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Freedom From Form and Rate Filing Regulations</h1></div><p><span>
All states have regulations requiring admitted insurers to file their policy forms and rates for most types of insurance with the insurance commissioner for approval. This is a major reason why admitted insurers are unwilling to accept the types of risks exported to the surplus lines market. </span><span>
The time and expense required to make the filing needed to properly handle such risks are seldom, if ever, justified by the resulting premium.</span></p><p>
A surplus lines insurer, on the other hand, is not subject to the form and rate filing regulations of the states from which it accepts exported risks. This freedom from filing regulations is an essential characteristic of the surplus lines market that enables it to perform its intended function. Without this freedom, surplus lines insurers would not have the flexibility to adjust coverage terms and policy premiums as required to accept the types of risks submitted to them. </p><p>
In some cases, surplus lines insurers develop entirely new policy forms and rates for new or emerging loss exposures and other risks that require insurance from the surplus lines market. Freedom from form and rate regulation reduces the time and expense required to bring new insurance products to the market.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
The Surplus Lines Distribution System</h1></div><p><span>
The agents and brokers representing insurance buyers are often referred to as &ldquo;retail&rdquo; agents or brokers, or simply &ldquo;retailers.&rdquo; </span><span>
Surplus lines insurance is distributed through licensed surplus lines intermediaries. Surplus lines licensees that serve as intermediaries between a retail agent or broker and a surplus lines insurer are often called &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; brokers or &ldquo;wholesalers.&rdquo; </span></p><p>
All states permit retail agents and brokers to obtain a surplus lines license or surplus lines authority, which allows them to place insurance directly with surplus lines insurers that accept business from retail licensees. However, many retail agents and brokers do not hold a surplus lines license and therefore seek the services and expertise of a surplus lines broker as needed.</p><p><span>
Licensed surplus lines intermediaries play an essential role in exporting risks to the surplus lines market. </span><span>
They are knowledgeable about exposures presented by distressed, unique, high-capacity, and new risks. They have established relationships with specialized insurers that accept these types of risks. In some cases, surplus lines intermediaries even perform the underwriting function for surplus lines insurers.</span></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Surplus Lines Insurers</h1></div><p><span>
Not every nonadmitted insurer is a surplus lines insurer. </span><span>
The surplus lines law in each state restricts surplus lines licensees to placing coverage with insurers that satisfy specific criteria. The goal is to protect the public by verifying the financial strength and viability of nonadmitted insurers providing coverage. Surplus lines laws often refer to these insurers as eligible surplus lines insurers. </span></p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading">

Just as admitted insurers are the risk bearers in the standard market, eligible surplus lines insurers are the risk bearers in the surplus lines market. And just as admitted insurers use <a data-original-title="

reinsurance</a> to stabilize loss experience, enhance their capacity to write new business, provide catastrophe protection, and obtain other benefits, so too do surplus lines insurers. </span><span>
Surplus lines insurers must develop strong relationships with reinsurers because they often write business for customers involved in hazardous or unique operations. Reinsurance allows a surplus lines insurer to provide coverage for such operations.</span></p><p>
Surplus lines insurers perform the same functions as admitted insurers and employ underwriters, claim representatives, risk control personnel, premium auditors, and others. These individuals are skilled specialists who understand the loss exposures and needs of customers in the specific markets the surplus lines insurer has targeted.</p></div></div><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Surplus Lines Insurance Products</h1></div><p>
Surplus lines insurance products differ from standard market products in terms and conditions, pricing, claim handling, risk control services, and risk management support provided by intermediaries. Freedom from form and rate filing requirements and expertise in assessing distressed, unique, high-capacity, and new risks make the surplus lines market the ideal source of new products and services. Without these factors, the surplus lines market could not exist because it would offer nothing different from the standard market.</p><p><span>
Surplus lines insurers innovate in response to changes in buyer-driven needs, technology-driven needs, socially or environmentally driven needs, and regulatory-driven needs. In many cases, products developed in the surplus lines market are eventually adopted and offered by the standard market after these products and related loss experiences become better understood. Examples include employment practices liability coverage and environmental liability coverage. </span><span>
As a result, the surplus lines market must continue to develop new products to respond to changing needs. Cyber risk coverage, designed to cover losses arising from e-commerce, is an example of a recent surplus lines product innovation that has already begun to migrate to the admitted market.</span></p><div class="mcq-component"><div class="mcq-title"><h2 class="mcq-title"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span>
