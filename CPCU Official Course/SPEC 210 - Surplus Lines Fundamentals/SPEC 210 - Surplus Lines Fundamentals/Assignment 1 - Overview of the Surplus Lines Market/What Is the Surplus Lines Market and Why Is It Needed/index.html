When faced with a hard-to-place risk that has been declined by insurers in the standard market, where can a producer turn to obtain the required coverage for his or her customer?</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Why the Surplus Lines Market Matters</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
As we think about the many types of insurance policies that producers write to meet their customer&rsquo;s needs, we sometimes come across a risk that most insurers will not insure. Usually, the extent of risk in underwriting that exposure is beyond the insurer&rsquo;s capacity in terms of costs or recurrence of losses. </i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Let&rsquo;s take a look at the surplus lines market and its role in meeting the atypical exposures of some insureds.</i></p><div audience="CEU" class="overlay"><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><a href="07014AudioS3.mp3" aria-label="Audio File" role="button" class="btn btn-primary audioFile"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up"></span>

It can be difficult to obtain insurance for some risks because of their characteristics. When the standard market is unable or unwilling to provide coverage, producers can turn to the surplus lines market (also known as the excess and surplus, or E&amp;S, market) to find the insurance protection their customers need. </span><span>
Surplus lines risks are traditionally classified as distressed, unique, or high capacity.</span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
The Surplus Lines Market: Some of the Terms You Need to Know</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re discussing the surplus lines market with co-workers, clients, or other industry professionals, knowing these terms and when to use them will help you communicate more effectively:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
Admitted insurers&mdash;This is an insurer to which a state insurance department has granted a license to do business within that state. State insurance departments require admitted insurers to file and obtain approval for their rates, forms, and underwriting rules.</i></li><li><i>
Admitted market, or standard market&mdash;Collectively, insurers in the admitted, or standard, market are those that voluntarily offer insurance coverages at rates designed for customers with average or better-than-average loss exposures. </i></li><li><i>
Surplus lines market&mdash;In contrast to the admitted market, the surplus lines market is the distribution system of surplus lines insurers and the intermediaries that provide insurance on risks for which insurance is not available from admitted insurers.</i></li><li><i>
Nonadmitted insurer&mdash;A nonadmitted insurer is an insurer that is not authorized by the state insurance department to do business within that state.</i></li><li><i>
Surplus lines law&mdash;This is a state law that permits any producer with a surplus lines license issued by that state to procure insurance from an eligible surplus lines insurer if the applicant cannot obtain the desired type of insurance in the admitted market.</i></li><li><i>
Distressed risk&mdash;Distressed risk is characterized by unfavorable attributes that have made it unacceptable to admitted insurers.</i></li><li><i>
Unique risk&mdash;Unique risk is so specialized or unusual that admitted insurers are unwilling to insure it, even though its characteristics are not unfavorable.</i></li><li><i>
High-capacity risk&mdash;This risk requires high limits of insurance that may exceed the underwriting criteria of admitted insurers.</i></li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

admitted market, or standard market</a>. In an effort to maintain insurer solvency and to protect consumers, state insurance departments require admitted insurers to file and obtain approval for their rates, forms, and underwriting rules. </span><span>
Because they cannot deviate from their approved filings, admitted insurers in the standard market do not have the flexibility to underwrite high-risk loss exposures profitably. For example, a standard market insurer might decline to insure a high-rise condominium in a hurricane-prone area. </span></p><p><span>
In addition, it is usually not cost-effective for standard market insurers to develop the underwriting expertise needed to insure highly specialized loss exposures, such as space satellites. These constraints create a need for a supplementary market that can accommodate special risks. </span><span>

Insurance purchased through the surplus lines market is provided by <a data-original-title="

nonadmitted insurers</a>, which are not licensed to operate in the insured&rsquo;s home state. Under each state&rsquo;s <a data-original-title="

surplus lines law</a>, licensed surplus lines brokers are permitted to place insurance with approved, nonadmitted insurers for risks that cannot be placed in the admitted market. </span><span>
Nonadmitted insurers typically are not required to obtain approval for their rates, forms, and underwriting rules. As a result, they can modify coverage and pricing in ways that allow them to underwrite special risks profitably. </span><span>
This benefits consumers by providing them with coverage that would otherwise not be available. Many businesses and not-for-profit organizations would be unable to operate without these surplus lines coverages.</span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
A Supplementary Market: What&rsquo;s the Point?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When analyzing a client&rsquo;s insurance needs, you might find some loss exposures that require highly specialized knowledge to underwrite or that expose an admitted insurer to more risk than it can underwrite profitably because state-approved rates, forms, and underwriting rules are not flexible in any case. Nonadmitted insurers in the surplus lines market can customize their rates, forms, and underwriting rules and change them without government approval. Therefore, they have the flexibility to insure such loss exposures and still make a profit.</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
You will find that surplus lines underwriters develop the necessary expertise for the types of coverage they write and that these insurers can modify coverage and pricing in ways that allow them to underwrite special risks profitably. Consumers benefit from the availability of coverage for these unusual risks, as some organizations cannot operate without surplus lines coverages. Finding coverage for your clients&rsquo; unusual loss exposures allows you to offer exceptional service.</i></p><p><span>
The surplus lines market writes a wide variety of risks and coverages. </span><span>
Risk examples include airports, amusement parks, drug and alcohol treatment centers, hazardous waste facilities, medical centers, mobile home parks, railroads, security services, and sports facilities. Coverage provided may include, among others, professional liability, environmental impairment liability, excess and umbrella liability, kidnap and ransom, and event cancellation. To a lesser extent, individuals and families may have loss exposures that can be insured only in the surplus lines market, such as a valuable art collection or homes in areas prone to hurricanes or earthquakes.</span></p><p>
Almost any coverage that cannot be written in the standard market is eligible for placement in the surplus lines market. However, state laws generally require workers compensation and automobile liability coverage to be placed with admitted insurers.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

A traditional method of classifying risks insured in the surplus lines market uses three broad categories to describe the characteristics that make risks unacceptable in the standard market:</p><ul><li>
Distressed risks</li><li>
Unique risks</li><li>
High-capacity risks</li></ul><p><span>
Underwriters in the standard market generally prefer to avoid a <a data-original-title="
A risk characterized by unfavorable attributes that have made it unacceptable to admitted insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
distressed risk</a>. A property risk with a large recent loss attributable to poor maintenance or an apartment complex with a high frequency of general liability losses could be unacceptable to standard market insurers. </span><span>
Similarly, an insured that engages in hazardous operations, such as crop dusting or serving alcoholic beverages to the public, might be unable to obtain insurance in the standard market.</span></p><p><span>
Unlike a distressed risk, a <a data-original-title="
A risk that is so specialized or unusual that admitted insurers are unwilling to insure it." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
unique risk </a> does not necessarily have unfavorable attributes. Examples include special events, like festivals or parades, or a medical device manufacturer that needs products liability coverage while a new product is in clinical trials. </span><span>
Admitted insurers are generally unwilling to insure unique risks for a number of reasons. Typically, their staff does not have the specialized skills to underwrite and price the coverage, and they may not have a policy form that appropriately covers the exposure. Moreover, they do not expect to insure an adequate number of similar risks. The premium they can charge may not justify the administrative expense of underwriting and rating the risk.</span></p><p>
A <a data-original-title="
A risk that requires high limits of insurance that may exceed the underwriting criteria of admitted insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
high-capacity risk</a> represents a significant loss exposure that standard insurers prefer to avoid. A museum may own an art collection insured for more than $1 billion. A chemical plant could become legally liable for several hundred million dollars in damages if a toxic chemical were to escape in large quantities.</p><p><span>
Closely related to unique risks is the fourth category of new risks. Because surplus lines insurers are not subject to rate and form filing regulations, the surplus lines market has the flexibility to respond to new or emerging risks more quickly than the standard market. </span><span>
For example, employment practices liability insurance, environmental insurance, and cyber risk coverages all originated in the surplus lines market before eventually being offered in the standard market. These coverages continue to be written in the surplus lines market for insureds that are unacceptable to admitted insurers.</span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

Surplus Lines Solution for a Daycare Center</b></p><p>
Tony is a commercial lines producer at Regional Insurance Brokerage. He has been approached by the owners of a new venture, ABC Daycare. The owners want to obtain the property, liability, and workers compensation coverage they need to begin operations. Tony knows he will be able to place the property and workers compensation coverage relatively easily, but he is concerned that daycare centers present liability loss exposures most standard insurers prefer to avoid. He explains the situation to his clients and says that the only real option is the surplus lines market. Tony approaches a surplus lines broker who is able to place ABC&rsquo;s daycare liability coverage with a nonadmitted insurer that offers a special policy designed specifically for daycare operators. Although the premium is higher than the owners had anticipated, they are pleased with the coverage and accept the price because they would not have been able to open their doors without the required liability coverage.</p></div><div class="panel-footer"><span class="daid">

The surplus lines market benefits consumers by providing coverage that is not available through the standard market. Nonadmitted insurers can write risks declined by the standard market because they have more underwriting flexibility than admitted insurers. Distressed risks, unique risks, high-capacity risks, and new risks are most commonly insured in the excess and surplus lines market.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Overview of the Surplus Lines Market and Why It Is Needed: That&rsquo;s a Wrap!

</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re thinking about the topics we just discussed, it&rsquo;s helpful to remember these key points:

</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
When the standard market is unable or unwilling to provide coverage, producers can turn to the surplus lines market (also known as the E&amp;S market) to find the insurance protection their customers need.</i></li><li><i>
Insurance purchased through the surplus lines market is provided by nonadmitted insurers, which are not licensed to operate in the insured&rsquo;s home state. 
</i></li><li><i>
Under each state&rsquo;s surplus lines law, licensed surplus lines brokers are permitted to place insurance with approved, nonadmitted insurers for risks that cannot be placed in the admitted market.  
</i></li><li><i>
Nonadmitted insurers typically are not required to obtain approval for their rates, forms, and underwriting rules, which creates flexibility to modify coverage and pricing in ways that allow them to underwrite special risks profitably.
</i></li><li><i>
Consumers benefit by obtaining coverage that would otherwise not be available and that may be required for their continued operation. 
</i></li><li><i>
Distressed risks are those that underwriters in the standard market generally prefer to avoid because they have high-value potential losses (a new high-rise office building in a hurricane-prone area ), have high frequency of general liability losses (an apartment building with multiple general liability losses), or are excessively hazardous operations (crop dusting).</i></li><li><i>
A unique risk does not necessarily have unfavorable attributes, but admitted insurers are generally unwilling to insure them for reasons such as these: staff lacks specialized skills to underwrite and price the coverage, they have no policy form for that exposure, the number of similar risks is inadequate, or the premium does not justify the expense of underwriting and rating the risk.</i></li><li><i>
A high-capacity risk represents a significant loss exposure that standard insurers prefer to avoid, such as a highly valued art collection or a chemical plant for which a toxic chemical spill could cause significant liability claims.
</i></li><li><i>
The surplus lines market has the flexibility to respond to new or emerging risks more quickly than the standard market.</i></li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small" id="glossary2">Glossary</h1></div><dl class="dl-horizontal"><span><dt class="keyword">
