Regulation of Surplus Lines Transactions</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><div class="objective"><div class="objective-content"><p class="eotitle">
Objective</p><p>
Describe the regulatory compliance requirements that generally apply to surplus lines intermediaries, as well as the role performed by surplus lines stamping offices.</p></div></div><p>
The states regulate surplus lines transactions through licensed surplus lines intermediaries. A surplus lines insurer, because it is not licensed in the state or states where it is insuring risks, is not subject to regulation by those states. Therefore, it is essential that surplus lines intermediaries understand their regulatory duties and perform them correctly.</p><p><span>
Regulation of surplus lines insurance is accomplished through state control and monitoring of surplus lines intermediaries. </span><span>
Regulators require that intermediaries obtain a surplus lines license and fulfill a number of duties with respect to each surplus lines transaction. Duties can vary by state, but these are typical activities:</span></p><ul><li>
Verify that the producer has made a diligent search for coverage in the admitted market and file the required affidavit or documentation</li><li>
Determine whether the insurer is eligible to write surplus lines insurance in the state</li><li>
Maintain policy files for possible state regulatory audit</li><li>
Collect a surplus lines premium tax from policyholders and remit the tax to the state</li><li>
Disclose to the policyholder that the surplus lines insurer is a nonadmitted insurer and the policy has no, or limited, guaranty fund protection</li></ul><p>
State surplus lines stamping offices, often called surplus lines associations, exist in fourteen states. These organizations are established to facilitate and encourage licensees&rsquo; compliance with regulations.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Licensing</h1></div><p>
To obtain a surplus lines broker&rsquo;s license in most states, the applicant must satisfy a number of requirements:</p><p>
To place an account in the surplus lines market, a surplus lines intermediary must have what is commonly referred to as a surplus lines broker&rsquo;s license in the insured&rsquo;s home state. </p><p>
Surplus lines intermediaries are licensed on a resident basis in their home state. Once they have a resident license, they can acquire a nonresident license in other states. Having a nonresident surplus lines license from another state allows a surplus lines intermediary to procure insurance for an insured whose home state is that other state.</p><ul><li>
Be a licensed resident agent or broker for placing property-casualty insurance with admitted insurers</li><li>
Pass a written examination</li><li>
Pay an annual licensing fee</li><li>
Provide a license bond that protects the policyholder against loss of premiums paid to the broker and the state against loss of any unpaid surplus lines premium taxes</li></ul><p>
Surplus lines licensees also must fulfill continuing education requirements, which vary by state, to maintain a surplus lines license.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Diligent Search and Filing of Affidavits</h1></div><p><span>
Generally, before marketing a prospective insured to surplus lines insurers, a good-faith <a data-original-title="
A surplus lines regulatory requirement establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable from admitted insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
diligent search</a> of the admitted market is required. State laws and regulations often specify the number of admitted insurer declinations needed to satisfy the diligent search requirement. </span><span>
The surplus lines licensee conducting the transaction must document the details of these declinations and submit them to regulators, usually in the form of a <a data-original-title="
A signed statement summarizing efforts to find coverage from admitted insurers and establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable in that market." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
diligent search affidavit</a>. Each state specifies a time frame within which the affidavit or required documentation must be filed. Some states require only a summary of efforts to obtain coverage from admitted insurers. </span><span>
However, most states specify the information that must be shown on the affidavit, which usually includes these items:</span></p><ul><li>
The names and addresses of the insured, surplus lines licensee, retail agent, and surplus lines insurer</li><li>
A description of the diligent search for coverage in the admitted market</li><li>
The reasons for using a surplus lines insurer for the coverage</li><li>
Confirmation that the policyholder has received written notification of the lack of guaranty fund protection and other limitations of using a surplus lines insurer</li></ul><p>
In some situations, the diligent search requirement may not apply. Some states have created an <a data-original-title="
A list of coverages or classes of business that can be &ldquo;exported&rdquo; (written in the surplus lines market) without fulfilling the diligent search requirement. " data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
export list</a> to simplify surplus lines transactions involving coverages generally unavailable from admitted insurers. The coverages or risks on export lists vary by state.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Determining Insurer Eligibility</h1></div><p>
A surplus lines intermediary can place business only with eligible surplus lines insurers. The intermediary must verify that a surplus lines insurer meets eligibility criteria before procuring insurance from that insurer. </p><p>
States may use any one of three approaches to identify eligible surplus lines insurers. The majority of states publish a <a data-original-title="
An approach to determining eligible surplus lines insurers in which the state insurance regulator compiles a list of eligible surplus lines insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
white list (eligibility list)</a> of surplus lines insurers that meet the state&rsquo;s eligibility standards. Other states use a <a data-original-title="
An approach to determining eligible surplus lines insurers in which the state establishes standards and brokers determine whether a particular insurer meets those standards." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
broker responsibility</a> approach, and a few states use a <a data-original-title="
An approach to determining eligible surplus lines insurers in which the state insurance regulator compiles a list of insurers that are determined to be ineligible for surplus lines insurance transactions." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
black list (ineligibility list)</a>. Black lists also might supplement a broker responsibility approach.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Recordkeeping</h1></div><p><span>
Each surplus lines transaction must be reported to either state regulators or the appropriate state surplus lines stamping office, along with required documentation. Detailed recordkeeping is essential. </span><span>
Surplus lines intermediaries must keep sufficient information about each transaction conducted with a surplus lines insurer to clearly document their compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Any state in which they are licensed and have done business may audit their records.</span></p><p>
 The details that surplus lines intermediaries must retain about each transaction generally include such items as information about the retail producer, name and address of the insured and insurer, a copy of the policy, a description of the exposure, amount of insurance and the perils insured against, effective date of coverage, policy premium, premium tax, and a copy of the diligent search affidavit.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Collecting Premium Tax</h1></div><p><span>
Government regulation of business is often directly linked to taxation. For example, all states impose a premium tax on admitted insurers, which pay this tax directly to the state. </span><span>
Surplus lines transactions are also subject to a premium tax in each state. However, because surplus lines insurers operate on a nonadmitted basis and are not subject to state jurisdiction, the surplus lines intermediary conducting the transaction is responsible for collecting the surplus lines premium tax from the insured and remitting it to the state. </span></p><p><span>
Because of a federal law known as the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (NRRA), which took effect on July 21, 2011, only the insured&rsquo;s &ldquo;home state&rdquo; has jurisdiction to regulate a surplus lines transaction, and the surplus lines intermediary is required to remit tax only to that state in accordance with its law. </span><span>
For a business, the NRRA defines &ldquo;home state&rdquo; as the state where its headquarters or &ldquo;principal place of business&rdquo; is located. For an individual, the NRRA defines &ldquo;home state&rdquo; as the state where the principal residence is located. </span></p><p><span>
Under the NRRA, the states may, if they choose, establish premium tax-sharing compacts or agreements. To date, the states have not been able to agree on a consistent method for tax sharing. </span><span>
While some states do not wish to participate in any surplus lines tax-sharing arrangement, other states subscribe to one of two models: </span></p><ul><li>
The Nonadmitted Insurance Multistate Agreement (NIMA) developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners </li><li>
The Surplus Lines Insurance Multistate Tax Compact (SLIMPACT) introduced by the National Council of Insurance Legislators </li></ul><p>
The National Association of Professional Surplus Lines Offices (NAPSLO) is working with state regulators to build consensus and develop a simplified, uniform approach to implementing the NRRA and tax sharing.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Disclosure to Policyholder</h1></div><p><span>
To ensure that surplus lines insurance purchasers understand the limited regulatory oversight and protection provided to the insured, most states require written disclosure of the limitations to the policyholder. </span><span>
Typically, a state requires that all surplus lines policies include a statement indicating that the insurer is not licensed by the state and is not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as admitted insurers and that the policy is not subject to the insolvency protection provided by the state insurance <a data-original-title="
A state-established fund that provides a system for the payment of some of the unpaid claims of insolvent insurers licensed in that state, generally funded by assessments collected from all insurers licensed in the state." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
guaranty fund</a>. The wording of the disclosure statement varies by state, and each state specifies whether the statement is to be attached to or stamped on the policy, where it is to be located in the policy, and how it is to appear in terms of print size and type.</span></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Surplus Lines Stamping Offices</h1></div><p>
State surplus lines <a data-original-title="

To ensure an efficient, reputable, and financially stable surplus lines market </li><li>
To monitor the activities of people and entities involved in surplus lines insurance and to facilitate regulatory compliance by the state&rsquo;s surplus lines licensees </li><li>
To protect the state&rsquo;s tax revenues </li><li>
To protect consumers by ensuring that those seeking surplus lines coverage have access to financially sound and reputable surplus lines insurers</li><li>
To protect buyers of insurance by ensuring that surplus lines policies are issued with appropriate disclosures and any other required policy language</li></ul><p>
To accomplish these goals, surplus lines associations perform a number of activities:</p><ul><li>
Offer newsletters, bulletins, reports, seminars, and Web sites containing information about surplus lines insurance. </li><li>
Distribute lists of eligible surplus lines insurers to surplus lines licensees. </li><li>
Evaluate the financial stability of eligible surplus lines insurers. </li><li>
Advocate regulatory and legislative changes to improve access to surplus lines insurance </li><li>
Distribute and explain changes in statutes, regulations, or rulings related to surplus lines insurance.</li><li>
Record premiums and tax liabilities for each surplus lines licensee. </li><li>
Compile premium data for statistical purposes and file periodic reports with regulators on the state&rsquo;s surplus lines transactions. The stamping office facilitates accurate, timely remittance of the surplus lines premium tax to the states by its member brokers.</li></ul><p><span>
In some states, the office is an independent, stand-alone organization created by statute. In other states, it operates under insurance department regulation. </span><span>
Expenses are funded by a fee paid by surplus lines members. Surplus lines associations are subject to periodic review by state regulators to ensure their operations meet the needs of the public.</span></p><div class="mcq-component"><div class="mcq-title"><h2 class="mcq-title"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span>
