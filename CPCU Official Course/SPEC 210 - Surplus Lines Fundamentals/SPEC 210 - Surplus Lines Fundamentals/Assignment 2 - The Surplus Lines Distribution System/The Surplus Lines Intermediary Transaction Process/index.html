The Surplus Lines Intermediary Transaction Process: Some of the Terms You Need to Know</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you're discussing the surplus lines intermediary's transaction process with coworkers, clients, or other industry professionals, knowing these terms and when to use them will help you communicate more effectively:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
Underwriting submission&mdash;This is the transmission of underwriting information for the initial offering of a prospective account, the major updating of a file on an established account, or a request for approval to execute a bond.</i></li><li><i>
Hazard&mdash;This is a condition that increases the frequency or severity of a loss.</i></li><li><i>
Risk control&mdash;This is a conscious act or decision not to act that reduces the frequency and/or severity of losses or makes losses more predictable.</i></li><li><i>
Annual report&mdash;This report is a source of accounting information of a publically held company that contains a description of the company&rsquo;s background and growth and an analysis of the previous year&rsquo;s operation; prepared by the management of the company.</i></li><li><i>
Form 10-K&mdash;This is an annual report that contains financial statistics, supplemental statements, and a narrative section (management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis); required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of all publicly traded companies to update their registration statement.</i></li><li><i>
Financial statement&mdash;This document quantitatively presents an organization&rsquo;s financial activities or status.</i></li><li><i>
Risk control report&mdash;This report contains account information gathered as a result of a physical inspection by an insurer&rsquo;s risk control representative specifically at the request of an underwriter.</i></li><li><i>
Reinsurance&mdash;This is the transfer of insurance risk from one insurer to another through a contractual agreement under which one insurer (the reinsurer) agrees, in return for a reinsurance premium, to indemnify another insurer (the primary insurer) for some or all of the financial consequences of certain loss exposures covered by the primary insurer&rsquo;s insurance policies.</i></li><li><i>
Treaty reinsurance&mdash;This is a reinsurance agreement that covers an entire class or portfolio of loss exposures and provides that the primary insurer&rsquo;s individual loss exposures that fall within the treaty are automatically reinsured.</i></li><li><i>
Facultative reinsurance&mdash;This is the reinsurance of individual loss exposures in which the primary insurer chooses which loss exposures to submit to the reinsurer, and the reinsurer can accept or reject any loss exposures submitted.</i></li><li><i>
Primary layer&mdash;This is the first level of insurance coverage above any deductible.</i></li><li><i>
Excess coverage&mdash;This insurance covers losses above an attachment point, below which there is usually another insurance policy or a self-insured retention.</i></li><li><i>
Underwriting cycle&mdash;This is a cyclical pattern of insurance pricing in which a soft market (low rates, relaxed underwriting, and underwriting losses) is eventually followed by a hard market (high rates, restrictive underwriting, and underwriting gains) before the pattern again repeats itself.</i></li><li><i>

        </a></p></div><p><span>
The first step in the process is qualifying the <a data-original-title="
Underwriting information for an initial application, or a substantive policy midterm or renewal change." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
underwriting submission</a>, which involves gathering information and evaluating the account. Because surplus lines intermediaries tend to specialize, they need to determine whether they have the expertise and contacts to meet that particular customer&rsquo;s needs. </span><span>
Surplus lines intermediaries generally qualify a submission by answering questions such as these: </span></p><ul><li>
Which retail producer is making the submission? Does that producer handle the account now? If so, why is the retailer involving a wholesaler? If not, what are the chances of displacing the current producer, often referred to as the &ldquo;incumbent&rdquo;? </li><li>
Who is the current insurer? Is it an admitted insurer? Is the current insurer offering renewal? Does the retailer have direct access to that insurer? If so, why use a surplus lines intermediary? </li><li>
When does the retail producer need the quote? Is that time frame reasonable? </li><li>
What coverage is the retail producer asking the surplus lines intermediary to provide? </li><li>
What type of insurer is needed? Does the surplus lines intermediary have access to such an insurer? </li><li>
What underwriting information is needed? What underwriting information is available, and is all of the underwriting information being shared with the surplus lines intermediary? </li></ul><p>
Surplus lines intermediaries may modify the qualification step based on the relationship they have with the retail producer submitting the account. If the retailer is a regular customer, the intermediary might expedite the qualification step. If the retail producer is a new customer, qualifying the submission usually will be more involved. </p><p>
The qualification step is crucial. If the surplus lines intermediary does not fully understand the retail agent&rsquo;s needs, the transaction cannot be successful regardless of what occurs in subsequent steps. </p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Qualifying the Submission: What&rsquo;s the Point?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
To qualify the underwriting submission, the surplus lines intermediary gathers information and evaluates the account. The intermediary must determine whether he or she has the expertise and contacts to meet the customer&rsquo;s needs. Answers to questions regarding the retail producer, the current insurer, the type of coverage requested, any time constraints, available insurers, and underwriting information will help in that determination. The qualification step can be expedited promptly or can be more involved, depending on the relationship the intermediary has with the retail producer submitting the account.</i></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Preparing the Submission</h1></div><div audience="CEU" class="overlay"><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><a href="07018AudioS5.mp3" aria-label="Audio File" role="button" class="btn btn-primary audioFile"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up"></span>

        </a></p></div><p><span>
The second step is preparing the submission for the insurer. Preparing a quality submission is essential because of the characteristics that drive risks to the surplus lines market. </span><span>
Handling these risks requires both a high level of expertise and utmost good faith between the intermediary and the insurer. A professional underwriting submission describes the account and its loss exposures thoroughly, gives the underwriter all the information required to make an informed decision, and presents the information in a format that is clear and easy to understand. </span><span>
In general, high-quality submissions include five elements:</span></p><ul><li>
Descriptive narrative</li><li>
Loss data</li><li>
Financial information</li><li>
Familiarity with rating techniques</li><li>
Lead time</li></ul><p>
The narrative includes a description of the customer&rsquo;s business operations and associated loss exposures, all of the <a data-original-title="
A condition that increases the frequency or severity of a loss." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
hazards</a> associated with the account, and any <a data-original-title="
A conscious act or decision not to act that reduces the frequency and/or severity of losses or makes losses more predictable." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
risk control</a> measures currently in place. The intermediary suggests how the account should be handled and provides the rationale for any recommended changes to the existing program. </p><p>
To price coverage, the underwriter needs to review an account&rsquo;s claim history. Most underwriters require a minimum of three to five years of loss data. In addition, the intermediary should provide details of any large losses that occurred prior to that period. In case the underwriter has questions about other losses occurring before that period, the intermediary should have access to records of all prior losses. </p><p>
Complete and current financial information is an important element of a high-quality submission. The underwriter usually requires the customer&rsquo;s most recent <a data-original-title="
A source of accounting information of a publicly held company that contains a description of the company&rsquo;s background and growth and an analysis of the previous year&rsquo;s operation; prepared by the management of the company." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
annual report</a>, a <a data-original-title="
An annual report that contains financial statistics, supplemental statements, and a narrative section (management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis); required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of all publicly traded companies to update their registration statement." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
Form 10-K</a>, and a <a data-original-title="
A document that quantitatively presents an organization's financial activities or status." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
financial statement</a>, audited if possible. The surplus lines intermediary should review each of these documents thoroughly and be prepared to demonstrate an understanding of the customer&rsquo;s financial position if the underwriter has questions.</p><p><span>
Surplus lines intermediaries can improve their relationships with underwriters by being familiar with the rating techniques they use. </span><span>
Analyzing a loss exposure and understanding the rating process for that exposure gives surplus lines intermediaries insight into the submission from the underwriter&rsquo;s perspective. Intermediaries who have analyzed submissions in this way are better able to work cooperatively with underwriters in meeting the customer&rsquo;s needs. </span></p><p><span>
Most underwriters prefer two to four weeks of lead time to quote a surplus lines account. If time is short, the surplus lines intermediary should provide the underwriter with additional information to expedite the process.</span><span>
For example, if the customer is willing to provide the current insurer&rsquo;s inspection and <a data-original-title="
A record that contains account information gathered as a result of a physical inspection by an insurer&rsquo;s risk control representative specifically at the request of an underwriter." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
risk control report</a>, the surplus lines intermediary may find that the underwriter will be able to quote without new inspections. In the surplus lines market, many accounts are written within tight deadlines as a result of the trust between the surplus lines intermediary and the underwriter.</span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Preparing the Submission: What&rsquo;s the Point?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
 You will find that preparing a high-quality submission is essential to the surplus lines intermediary's role in the market. An expert intermediary who practices utmost good faith with the insurer will develop a submission that thoroughly describes the account and its loss exposures. Pricing is determined based on the submitted claim history, associated hazards, and any implemented loss controls. If timing is urgent, the intermediary should provide additional information to assist the process, such as the current insurer's inspection and risk control report.</i></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

            Play Audio
        </a></p></div><p><span>
The third step is submitting the account to an underwriter. </span><span>
Marketing an account involves a number of important considerations, such as whether to approach a single insurer, several, or many. Restricted marketing is appropriate when the number of insurers willing to consider an account is small, or when an account is so complex that the time involved in working with the underwriter precludes multiple submissions. </span><span>
On the other hand, when a submission is highly unusual, the surplus lines intermediary may have no idea how insurers will respond. In this case, approaching many insurers might prove most successful. For most accounts, however, it is typical to obtain quotes from several insurers.</span></p><p>
Surplus lines intermediaries can market submissions most successfully when they understand each insurer&rsquo;s underwriting focus. For example, if an insurer specializes in casualty insurance, it would be inappropriate to submit an application for property coverage.</p><p><span>
Laws, regulations, or agreements may stipulate that a customer must obtain insurance in the admitted market. This is referred to as the need for &ldquo;admitted paper.&rdquo; </span><span>
Surplus lines intermediaries must identify these customers before making a submission to an insurer on their behalf. If admitted paper is needed, the intermediary might suggest an alternative approach, such as finding an admitted insurer willing to issue a policy for which the surplus lines insurer would provide <a data-original-title="
The transfer of insurance risk from one insurer to another through a contractual agreement under which one insurer (the reinsurer) agrees, in return for a reinsurance premium, to indemnify another insurer (the primary insurer) for some or all of the financial consequences of certain loss exposures covered by the primary's insurance policies." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
reinsurance.</a></span></p><p><span>
A surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s reinsurance arrangements can affect the surplus lines transaction. Intermediaries cannot expect to know everything about an insurer&rsquo;s reinsurance program. </span><span>
However, knowing the limit of liability provided by <a data-original-title="
A reinsurance agreement that covers an entire class or portfolio of loss exposures and provides that the primary insurer's individual loss exposures that fall within the treaty are automatically reinsured." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
treaty reinsurance</a>, or whether the treaty contains certain exclusions, is helpful when deciding which insurer to approach with a submission or how best to handle an account. Underwriters are usually willing to share this information because it saves time for them and the surplus lines intermediary. </span><span>
When surplus lines intermediaries are aware of a source of <a data-original-title="
Reinsurance of individual loss exposures in which the primary insurer chooses which loss exposures to submit to the reinsurer, and the reinsurer can accept or reject any loss exposures submitted." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
facultative reinsurance</a> that would assist in writing an account by providing reinsurance beyond the surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s treaty, they should provide that information to the underwriter early in the process. </span></p><p><span>
Intermediaries also must determine whether the surplus lines coverage is to be written as the <a data-original-title="
The first level of insurance coverage above any deductible." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
primary layer</a> or as <a data-original-title="
Insurance that covers losses above an attachment point, below which there is usually another insurance policy or a self-insured retention." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
excess coverage</a>. </span><span>
Generally, it is easier to place excess coverage rather than primary coverage, because the primary insurer already has determined the terms and conditions for the initial placement, which excess insurers usually follow. While pricing of the excess layer still must be determined, it is usually less costly than the primary layer. </span></p><p><span>
It is crucial for the intermediary to have knowledge of the <a data-original-title="
A cyclical pattern of insurance pricing in which a soft market (low rates, relaxed underwriting, and underwriting losses) is eventually followed by a hard market (high rates, restrictive underwriting, and underwriting gains) before the pattern again repeats itself." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
underwriting cycle</a>, insurer loss experience, and any previous relationship between the customer and the insurer. </span><span>
During a hard market, insurers may limit the number of submissions an intermediary can make, and their interest in some classes of business may decrease. During a soft market, insurers will consider more types of business. </span><span>
Like the insurance cycle, loss experience can influence an insurer&rsquo;s underwriting. An unfavorable loss history often results in a pricing increase and greater selectivity by underwriters. </span><span>
Finally, to avoid embarrassment and wasted effort, before submitting an account, the intermediary should check whether the customer has had a negative experience with that insurer.</span></p><p><span>
The role of price in a customer&rsquo;s choice of insurer is important. Some customers may be more interested in price than in policy terms, conditions, and limits. </span><span>
Other customers move from insurer to insurer annually, indicating that insurer relationships mean little to them. Surplus lines intermediaries should keep in mind that a customer &ldquo;won&rdquo; because of a low price will likely be &ldquo;lost&rdquo; when another intermediary presents an even lower price. </span></p><p>
Finally, surplus lines intermediaries should consider an insurer&rsquo;s financial standing when marketing an account. Many intermediaries consider it wise to approach only those companies rated &ldquo;A&ndash;,&rdquo; &ldquo;A,&rdquo; &ldquo;A+,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A++&rdquo; by A.M. Best Company or comparably rated by other financial rating services. In some cases, either the retail agent or the customer will specify that only quotes from insurers with &ldquo;A&ndash;&rdquo; or better ratings will be considered. </p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Submitting the Account: What Did You Learn?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Q: Describe some of the considerations that the surplus lines intermediary makes when submitting an account to insurers.</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
A: The surplus lines intermediary must decide to how many insurers the submission should be made, which insurers&rsquo; underwriting focus matches the customer&rsquo;s account, whether admitted insurers are required, and whether reinsurance would make a submission acceptable for an admitted insurer. If using reinsurance, the intermediary must determine whether treaty or facultative reinsurance would be appropriate for the exposures and whether the surplus lines coverage should be the primary layer or excess coverage. The current phase of the underwriting cycle could assist in the intermediary&rsquo;s consideration of whether an admitted insurer might be interested in the submission, and he or she should consider the insurer&rsquo;s A.M. Best rating.</i></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

            Play Audio
        </a></p></div><p><span>
The fourth step in the process is presenting the insurers&rsquo; quotes to the customer. </span><span>
The surplus lines intermediary must decide how to present the quotes most effectively. Intermediaries may work diligently to obtain good quotes, only to find that the retail producer is ineffective in explaining them to the customer. For this reason, it is beneficial for the surplus lines intermediary and the retail agent to present the quotes jointly. </span></p><p>
Some surplus lines intermediaries present only the quote they consider the best, while others present all the quotes they received. In this case, the proposal package may include a pricing comparison as well as financial ratings of the insurers, a comparison of policy terms and conditions, the commissions paid by each insurer, and the binding requirements for each insurer.</p><p>
Because quotes can vary significantly when an account has been submitted to a number of insurers, it is important that the surplus lines intermediary explain to the customer the extent to which each quote responds to the loss exposures and why price should not be the only consideration. </p><p>
When selling quotes from surplus lines insurers, the intermediary should make sure the retail agent understands that the insurers are not admitted insurers and that surplus lines taxes are payable on the premium. The intermediary also should explain that surplus lines insurers do not participate in state insurance guaranty funds that pay insureds&rsquo; claims if the insurer becomes insolvent.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Presenting the Quotes: What Did You Learn?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Q: Describe some of the decisions that the surplus lines intermediary makes regarding the presentation of quotes.</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
A: The surplus lines intermediary must decide how best to present the quote(s) and whether to ask the retail agent to assist in the presentation to the customer. The intermediary must decide which quotes to present&mdash;only the best quote(s) or all of the quotes. These issues will determine the extent of the presentation, whether a pricing comparison and binding requirements are needed, and whether a description should be added regarding the extent to which each quote responds to the loss exposures and how that affects the price.</i></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Binding Coverage and Delivering the Policy</h1></div><div audience="CEU" class="overlay"><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><a href="07018AudioS8.mp3" aria-label="Audio File" role="button" class="btn btn-primary audioFile"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up"></span>
            Play Audio
        </a></p></div><p><span>
The fifth step in the process is binding coverage and delivering the contract. </span><span>
A <a data-original-title="
A temporary written or oral agreement to provide insurance coverage until a formal written policy is issued." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
binder</a> can be issued quickly and provides assurance that coverage is in effect. It includes a summary of the coverage, a brief description of any unique terms and conditions, estimated premiums and the premium basis (such as payroll or sales), audit provisions, the policy period, policy limits, and any other details that clarify the intent of the coverage. </span></p><p>
If the surplus lines intermediary is a managing general agent (MGA) for the insurer, the intermediary has authority to bind the business for the insurer. Copies of the binder should go to the retail agent and the underwriter. After coverage is bound, the MGA issues a policy in accordance with the terms and conditions quoted.</p><p><span>
If the surplus lines intermediary acts as a broker without binding authority, the broker requests that the insurer bind coverage and issue the policy. After coverage is bound, the broker notifies the retail agent and confirms the effective date of coverage. </span><span>
The insurer issues the policy and forwards it to the broker, who delivers it to the retail agent after checking for errors and ensuring the policy is issued in accordance with the quote and binder. </span></p><p>
If the broker determines the policy has not been issued in accordance with the quote and binder, the broker must resolve any differences quickly. Typically, the broker refers the insurer to the original quote and binder to confirm the intended coverage. Such situations, if not resolved promptly, can be the basis for an errors and omissions claim against the broker and possibly the retail agent.</p><p><span>
The broker is more concerned with discrepancies between the binder and policy terms than an MGA would be because of the difference in their relationships with insurers. With certain exceptions, the insurer is responsible for the actions of its agent, the MGA. </span><span>
Should the MGA exceed its authority with the insurer, the dispute is between the MGA and the insurer. The retail agent and the customer usually are not affected by such disputes. </span><span>
In contrast, the insurer is generally not responsible for the broker&rsquo;s actions on its behalf. As a result, the retail agent might become involved if a coverage dispute arises. To avoid a coverage dispute, the broker and the insurer must have a clear understanding of the coverage being bound, and the policy must agree with the binder in all material respects. </span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

A: If the intermediary is an MGA for the insurer, the intermediary will use his or her authority to bind the business for the insurer. Copies of the binder should go to the retail agent and the underwriter. After coverage is bound, the MGA issues a policy in accordance with the terms and conditions quoted.

The sixth and final step in the surplus lines intermediary transaction process is providing ancillary services during the policy period. Delivery of the policy marks the beginning of the maintenance stage of the transaction. </span><span>
These ancillary services can be grouped as regulatory compliance services and policy maintenance services. </span></p><p>
Services related to regulatory compliance include these: </p><ul><li>

The Surplus Lines Intermediary Transaction Process: That&rsquo;s a Wrap!</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re thinking about the topics we just discussed, it&rsquo;s helpful to remember these key points:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
For the surplus lines intermediary, the surplus lines transaction process consists of six steps.</i></li><li><i>
To qualify the underwriting submission, the surplus lines intermediary gathers information to evaluate the account by answering questions regarding the parties, the type of coverage, any time constraints, available insurers, and underwriting information, as well as his or her ability to meet the customer&rsquo;s needs.</i></li><li><i>
An expert intermediary will develop a submission that thoroughly describes the account and its loss exposures, along with its claim history, associated hazards, and any implemented loss controls. If timing is urgent, the intermediary provides additional information to assist the process.</i></li><li><i>
When submitting an account to insurers, the intermediary decides to how many insurers the submission should be made, which insurers&rsquo; underwriting focus matches the customer&rsquo;s account, whether admitted insurers are required, and whether reinsurance would make a submission acceptable for an admitted insurer. If using reinsurance, the intermediary must determine whether treaty or facultative reinsurance would be appropriate and whether the surplus lines coverage should be the primary layer or excess coverage.</i></li><li><i>
The intermediary must decide how best to present the quote(s) and whether to ask the retail agent to assist in the presentation; which quotes to present&mdash;only the best quote(s) or all of the quotes; whether a pricing comparison and binding requirements should be included; and whether a description should be added regarding the extent to which each quote responds to the loss exposures.</i></li><li><i>
If the intermediary is an MGA for the insurer, the intermediary will use his or her authority to bind the business for the insurer. After coverage is bound, the MGA issues a policy in accordance with the terms and conditions quoted. </i></li><li><i>
If the intermediary is a surplus lines broker with no binding authority, then he or she requests that the insurer bind coverage and issue the policy. After coverage is bound, the broker notifies the retail agent, then reviews the policy to confirm the effective date of coverage, check it for errors, and ensure that it is issued in accordance with the quote and binder. Then he or she delivers the policy to the retail agent.</i></li><li><i>
The intermediary provides ancillary services related to regulatory compliance, such as remitting surplus lines taxes, ensuring the policy complies with the insured&rsquo;s state regulations, and maintaining or filing any required affidavits.</i></li><li><i>
The intermediary&rsquo;s ancillary maintenance service differs depending on his or her status.</i></li><li><i>
If the intermediary is an MGA, he or she will issue policy endorsements for additions, deletions, or other changes in insurable loss exposures; audit insurable loss exposures as dictated by the policy terms; cancel a policy at the insured&rsquo;s request; and report claims to the insurer.</i></li><li><i>
If the intermediary is a surplus lines broker, he or she will request policy endorsements for additions, deletions, or other changes in insurable loss exposures; request cancellation of a policy if the customer asks for it; and report claims to the insurer. If the placement is on a brokerage basis, the insurer usually handles any audits and sends cancellation notices if the insurer no longer wants to provide coverage.</i></li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small" id="glossary2">Glossary</h1></div><dl class="dl-horizontal"><span><dt class="keyword">
