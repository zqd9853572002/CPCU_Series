Objective</p><p>
Distinguish among these different types of intermediaries in the surplus lines distribution system:</p><ul><li>
Retail agents or brokers</li><li>
Independent wholesale brokers</li><li>
National wholesalers</li><li>
Managing general agents</li><li>
Underwriting managers</li><li>
Program managers</li><li>
Lloyd&rsquo;s brokers</li></ul></div></div><p>
The surplus lines distribution system is a dynamic, evolving part of the insurance business that provides access to the surplus lines market for customers who cannot obtain coverage in the admitted market. The surplus lines market operates through a variety of intermediaries.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p><span>
Surplus lines intermediaries are licensed individuals or agencies that place business with surplus lines insurers. </span><span>
The terms used to refer to surplus lines intermediaries vary by state and include "agent," "broker," "producer," and "intermediary." Surplus lines intermediaries include retail producers, independent wholesale brokers, national wholesale brokers, managing general agents, underwriting managers, program managers, and Lloyd&rsquo;s brokers. </span><span>
These roles can overlap, so that one organization might function in several capacities. In most cases, a surplus lines intermediary acts as an intermediary between a surplus lines insurer and a retail producer to procure insurance for the retail producer's customer.</span></p></div><div class="col-md-6"><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading">

Retail Producers</h1></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p><span>
Retail producers deal directly with insurance buyers to obtain coverage in the standard market. </span><span>
A retail producer can be an insurance agent or an insurance broker. All retail producers must be licensed to place insurance with admitted insurers. Retail producers also may obtain a surplus lines license, which allows them to place business directly with surplus lines insurers. </span><span>
Retail producers who do not hold a surplus lines license can place surplus lines insurance through a licensed surplus lines intermediary. Some surplus lines insurers allow retail producers with a surplus lines license to place business directly with them, while other surplus lines insurers prefer to deal through wholesale brokers only.</span></p></div><div class="col-md-6"><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading">

[DA08665]</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Independent Wholesale Brokers</h1></div><p>
Independent wholesale brokers are generally, but not always, small to medium-size organizations that place business with a number of surplus lines insurers. They are often owner-operated.</p><p>
Independent wholesale brokers usually operate within their state of domicile or regionally, and the owners and principal producers are often active in their local communities. They develop strong relationships with local retail producers who come to depend on them for specific products and programs.</p><p>
Independent wholesale brokers might practice <a data-original-title="
A type of marketing that focuses on specific types of buyers who are a subset of a larger market." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
niche marketing</a> to gain a competitive advantage. For example, one might specialize in transportation coverage. This not only fills a need, but also attracts customers who may have additional surplus lines coverage needs. </p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
National Wholesalers</h1></div><p>
A national wholesaler is a more complex organization than local or regional wholesale brokers because of its size and ownership. National wholesalers usually have several offices strategically located in various parts of the country. They offer many kinds of surplus lines coverage and special programs for certain classes of business. </p><p>
National wholesalers can be independently owned, or they can be subsidiaries of larger organizations. Independent ownership gives wholesalers the freedom to deal with any retail producer or surplus lines insurer. However, it restricts their access to the exclusive products or programs available only to surplus lines intermediaries owned by larger organizations. </p><p>
A variety of organizations might acquire or establish a national wholesaler as a <a data-original-title="
A company owned or controlled by another company." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
subsidiary</a>:</p><ul><li>
An insurer</li><li>
A London brokerage </li><li>
A large retail brokerage </li><li>
An investor group</li></ul><p><span>
A national wholesaler that is a subsidiary of an insurer might operate independently, or it might rely on the insurer-owner to develop and offer exclusive surplus lines products or programs that are not available to other wholesalers. </span><span>
Exclusive products or programs create a competitive advantage for the wholesaler. However, a wholesaler owned by an insurer might be limited to placing business only with that insurer. </span></p><p><span>
A strong surplus lines market exists in London, made up of both <a data-original-title="
An association of investors, grouped in syndicates, who are represented by underwriters to write insurance and reinsurance." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
Lloyd's</a> and other underwriters. </span><span>
When a London brokerage firm wants to diversify its operations in the United States or increase U.S. business placed in the London market, acquiring a national wholesaler can be an effective strategy. The wholesaler gains knowledge of the London marketplace and access to the London broker's programs. </span></p><p>
A large retail brokerage that wants control over the placement of its customers&rsquo; business in the surplus lines market might acquire a subsidiary wholesaler to act exclusively for those customers. On the other hand, a retail brokerage might acquire a wholesaler simply as an investment, in which case it might not require its own surplus lines business to be placed through the subsidiary wholesaler.</p><p>
Investor groups that own wholesalers usually allow them to operate independently without ties to any other type of insurance operation.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Managing General Agents</h1></div><p><span><a data-original-title="
Independent business organizations that function almost as branch offices for one or more insurers and that appoint and supervise independent agents and brokers for insurers using the independent agency and brokerage system." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
Managing general agents (MGAs)</a> also act as surplus lines intermediaries, and they can represent one or more insurers. Their customers are primarily retail producers. They are given broad authority by the insurer or insurers they represent. </span><span>
MGAs generally are authorized to bind the insurer on loss exposures that fit the insurer&rsquo;s <a data-original-title="
A written manual that communicates an insurer&rsquo;s underwriting policy and that specifies the attributes of an account that an insurer is willing to insure." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
underwriting guidelines</a>. Having <a data-original-title="
An insurance agent's authority to effect coverage on behalf of the insurer." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
binding authority</a> sets MGAs apart from independent wholesalers and national wholesalers. </span></p><p>
Employees of an MGA act on behalf of the insurer and often hold the title of underwriter. The role of MGAs varies by the classes of business they are authorized to bind and by the policy limits allowed under their binding authority. MGAs issue policies and endorsements for most of the insurers they represent and are responsible for marketing and loss reporting for the policies they issue.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Underwriting Managers</h1></div><p><span>
Underwriting managers act on behalf of a single insurer and assume the role of a branch office for that insurer. They might be a subsidiary or independently owned. </span><span>
Underwriting managers differ from MGAs because of the relationship with and the authority from the insurer they represent. Underwriting managers have broad authority to bind the insurer, place reinsurance on its behalf, and settle claims. </span><span>
An underwriting manager&rsquo;s customers include retailers, wholesalers, or MGAs, while the customers of an MGA are primarily retail producers. </span></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Program Managers</h1></div><p>
Some insurers seek to expand by developing <a data-original-title="
An insurer's offering of a policy or combination of policies with special coverages, prices, or both to insureds with similar characteristics." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
program business</a>. Candidates for program business include organizations such as ambulance services, financial institutions, and automobile dealers. Members of each of these groups have similar characteristics, loss exposures, and insurance needs.</p><p>
Surplus lines intermediaries with expertise in a particular area also might develop insurance programs. Insurers interested in program business might offer <a data-original-title="
A surplus lines intermediary that has created a special, or niche, program that fits a particular market." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
program manager</a> contracts to these intermediaries. Program manager contracts are similar to MGA contracts, except they are usually limited to a specific program. </p><p>
Program managers might be a division of another type of intermediary or an independent agency with one or more programs. The insurer might authorize the program manager to accept business from retail or wholesale producers.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Lloyd&rsquo;s Brokers</h1></div><p><span>
Lloyd&rsquo;s (formerly called Lloyd&rsquo;s of London) underwrites a significant proportion of the surplus lines coverage in the U.S. and has a reputation for underwriting specialized and unique risks. </span><span>
Unlike insurance companies, Lloyd&rsquo;s is an insurance marketplace in which members' syndicates provide capital and accept surplus lines risks. Syndicates' day-to-day operations are administered by managing agents. </span></p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p><span>
Most of the business written by Lloyd's is submitted by Lloyd&rsquo;s brokers. A <a data-original-title="
An insurance broker who procures coverage in the Lloyd's market on behalf of insureds." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
Lloyd&rsquo;s broker</a> is a specialist who has been carefully evaluated and accredited by Lloyd&rsquo;s. </span><span>
He or she negotiates competitive terms and conditions with Lloyd&rsquo;s underwriters on behalf of insurance applicants. At present, more than 180 firms are qualified as Lloyd&rsquo;s brokers. </span></p><p>
When an insured requires a type of coverage that Lloyd's can provide, generally the insured&rsquo;s retail producer contacts a licensed surplus lines producer who, in turn, contacts a Lloyd&rsquo;s broker to access the Lloyd&rsquo;s market. The Lloyd&rsquo;s Web site provides a list of accredited Lloyd&rsquo;s brokers.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading">

The managing agents of Lloyd&rsquo;s syndicates also have the option of accepting business submitted by licensed surplus lines producers who are not accredited Lloyd's brokers. Lloyd&rsquo;s stipulates the minimum requirements such intermediaries must meet, and the managing agent is responsible for ensuring the intermediary qualifies.</p><div><p><a id="N8003B" href="OL_categoriesofsurpluslinesintermediaries.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">
