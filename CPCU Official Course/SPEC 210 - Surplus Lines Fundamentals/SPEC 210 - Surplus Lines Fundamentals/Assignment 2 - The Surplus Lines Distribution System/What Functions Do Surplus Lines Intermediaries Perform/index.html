Why the Functions That Surplus Lines Intermediaries Perform Matter</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
As you will learn, surplus lines intermediaries perform a number of functions when placing surplus lines business and managing surplus lines accounts. Each type of surplus lines intermediary performs additional functions that are specific to his or her role in the surplus lines transaction.

Some functions performed by surplus lines intermediaries are common to all types of intermediaries. Others vary depending on the type of intermediary involved in the transaction. For example, a wholesale broker might perform different functions than a managing general agent (MGA). </p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
The Functions That Surplus Lines Intermediaries Perform: Some of the Terms You Need to Know</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re discussing the functions that surplus lines intermediaries perform with co-workers, clients, or other industry professionals, knowing these terms and when to use them will help you communicate more effectively:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
Errors and omissions (E&amp;O)&mdash;Negligent acts (errors) committed by a person conducting insurance business that give rise to legal liability for damages, accompanied by a failure to act (omission), which creates legal liability. E&amp;O is an insurance coverage, and claims filed against that coverage are E&amp;O claims.</i></li><li><i>
Risk management process&mdash;The method of making, implementing, and monitoring decisions that minimize the adverse effects of risk on an organization.</i></li><li><i>
Diligent search affidavit&mdash;A signed statement summarizing efforts to find coverage from admitted insurers and establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable in that market.</i></li><li><i>
Diligent search&mdash;The surplus lines regulatory requirement to establish that coverage for the risk is unavailable from admitted insurers. The intermediary must conduct a diligent search to try to place the business with an insurer in the admitted market without success before placing it with an insurer in the nonadmitted market.</i></li><li><i>
Fiduciary&mdash;A person or entity that holds a position of trust, manages another person&rsquo;s or entity&rsquo;s affairs or funds, and has a duty to that person or entity to act in a trustworthy manner. A surplus line intermediary has fiduciary responsibilities to insurers and the state.</i></li><li><i>
Binder&mdash;A temporary written or oral agreement to provide insurance coverage until a formal written policy is issued.</i></li><li><i>
Program manager&mdash;A surplus lines intermediary that has created a special, or niche, program that fits a particular market.</i></li><li><i>
Program business&mdash;An insurer&rsquo;s offering of a policy or combination of policies with special coverages, prices, or both to insureds with similar characteristics.</i></li><li><i>

Several general functions are performed by surplus lines intermediaries:</p><ul><li>
Maintaining documentation</li><li>
Counseling</li><li>
Filing affidavits</li><li>
Collecting premium taxes</li><li>
Practicing sound management</li></ul><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Maintaining Documentation</h2></div><p><span>
Surplus lines intermediaries document each customer&rsquo;s file to record each transaction. They make written records of all telephone calls and face-to-face discussions and file all correspondence. </span><span>
Lack of documentation is one of the leading causes of misunderstandings and <a data-original-title="
Negligent acts (errors) committed by a person conducting insurance business that give rise to legal liability for damages; a failure to act (omission) that creates legal liability." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
errors and omissions (E&amp;O)</a> claims. Without proper documentation, customers and insurers can allege that intermediaries are responsible for any mistakes. </span></p><p>
In many states, the intermediary is responsible for maintaining copies of policies, which must be made available for review by state regulatory officials, if requested.</p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Counseling</h2></div><p><span>
Counseling is similar to the <a data-original-title="
The method of making, implementing, and monitoring decisions that minimize the adverse effects of risk on an organization." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
risk management process</a> that all producers help their customers perform. However, surplus lines intermediaries should take their counseling responsibility even more seriously than other producers because of their unique role in surplus lines marketing. </span><span>
Professional surplus lines intermediaries help customers identify loss exposures and match them with appropriate coverage. It is not enough merely to understand the coverage being requested by the customer or proposed by the retail agent. The intermediary must review all submissions thoroughly and offer advice on appropriate existing coverage as well as unique or new coverage that becomes available.</span></p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Filing Diligent Search Affidavits</h2></div><p><span>
The surplus lines intermediary is responsible for filing a <a data-original-title="
A signed statement summarizing efforts to find coverage from admitted insurers and establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable in that market." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
diligent search affidavit</a> for each account confirming that it has been declined by admitted insurers. State regulators often review affidavits to ensure surplus lines intermediaries and retail agents have met <a data-original-title="
A surplus lines regulatory requirement establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable from admitted insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
diligent search</a> requirements. </span><span>
Although the diligent search is the retail agent&rsquo;s responsibility, surplus lines laws hold the surplus lines intermediary responsible for filing the affidavit. This division of responsibility can cause problems for the surplus lines intermediary when no system is in place to assure the intermediary that the retail agent has performed the diligent search.</span></p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Collecting Premium Taxes</h2></div><p>
Intermediaries apply the appropriate surplus lines premium tax, collect it from the policyholder, and remit it to the state(s) to which the tax is owed. The surplus lines tax varies by state, and the intermediary must know the tax rules of the state in which the loss exposures are located. Correctly collecting and remitting taxes is an important responsibility for surplus lines intermediaries.</p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Practicing Sound Management</h2></div><p>
To demonstrate professionalism to customers and insurers, a surplus lines intermediary follows management guidelines such as these:</p><ul><li>
The operation of the office is organized and efficient.</li><li>
The intermediary honors his or her responsibilities as a <a data-original-title="
A person or entity that holds a position of trust, manages another person&rsquo;s or entity&rsquo;s affairs or funds, and has a duty to that person or entity to act in a trustworthy manner." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
fiduciary</a> to insurers and the state by collecting premiums and taxes from policyholders and holding those funds in trust.</li><li>
All transactions adhere to applicable state statutes and regulations.</li><li>
The intermediary acts at the highest ethical level. An intermediary&rsquo;s authority and responsibilities are extensive. Retail agents, surplus lines insurers, and regulators must be able to depend on intermediaries to execute those responsibilities in good faith.</li></ul><p>
The National Association of Professional Surplus Lines Offices (NAPSLO) provides a Code of Ethics for its members. This code provides intermediaries with guidelines for practicing sound management and for conducting their business ethically.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

Wholesale brokers have additional responsibilities beyond the general functions involved in dealing with retail agents and surplus lines insurers. </span><span>
Wholesale brokers analyze loss exposures and prepare submissions that present all of the information underwriters need to evaluate and quote on a risk. The more complete the submission, the more likely the underwriter is to provide a favorable quote. Wholesale brokers identify insurers that might be interested in each submission and determine the best method for approaching them. </span></p><p>
If a submission is large and complex, the wholesale broker might meet with the underwriter in person to review the submission. Some wholesale brokers involve the retail producer in this discussion. After receiving a quote, wholesale brokers prepare material the retail agent can use when making a presentation to the customer. </p><p><span>
If the customer accepts the insurer&rsquo;s quote and places an order, the insurer issues a <a data-original-title="
A temporary written or oral agreement to provide insurance coverage until a formal written policy is issued." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
binder</a>. Verbal binders must be confirmed in writing. </span><span>
The wholesale broker is responsible for delivering the policy to the customer promptly and ensuring the coverage and limits it provides are those requested and quoted. This is important because E&amp;O claims can arise from lack of attention to these details. </span><span>
Carefully checking the coverage and limits is a part of the transaction the wholesale broker should not delegate or neglect.</span></p><p><span>
Service after the sale also is an important function. This includes communicating policy changes and claim notices from the retail agent to the surplus lines insurer and soliciting renewals as each policy expires. </span><span>
The ability to write additional new business and the opportunity to renew existing accounts often depend on the level of service wholesale brokers provide and the relationships they develop.</span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Functions of Wholesale Brokers: What&rsquo;s the Point?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Beyond the general functions involved in dealing with retail agents and surplus lines insurers, wholesale brokers analyze loss exposures and prepare thorough submissions for underwriters to evaluate and quote a risk.

The functions of an MGA are similar to those of a wholesale broker. However, an MGA&rsquo;s most important responsibility is to follow the underwriting guidelines and binding authority the insurer has specified. </span><span>
Insurers grant binding authority for specific types of business, coverage, limits, and territories. Because MGAs depend on their binding authority to be able to place business, they must exercise that authority with care. </span><span>
MGAs that underwrite poorly and cause excessive losses soon find that insurers are unwilling to grant them binding authority. </span></p><p>
An MGA with a staff of well-trained, knowledgeable underwriters earns a reputation for serving customers and insurers well. The underwriters must be familiar with loss exposures, pricing, and coverage, and they must understand the extent of the binding authority granted by each insurer they represent. They also must know the types of loss exposures for which each insurer does not want to offer coverage. </p><p>
After MGAs issue policies, they perform the same post-sale service functions that wholesale brokers perform. An MGA that offers a wide variety of coverage, high-quality products, and prompt service serves its customers well. A reputation for poor service results in lost business.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
