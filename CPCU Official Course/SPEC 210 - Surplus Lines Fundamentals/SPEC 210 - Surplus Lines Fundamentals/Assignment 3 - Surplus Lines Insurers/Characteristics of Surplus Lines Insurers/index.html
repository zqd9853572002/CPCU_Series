Surplus lines insurers are an essential component of the surplus lines market and have a number of attributes that enable them to perform their role effectively.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Why the Characteristics of Surplus Lines Insurers Matter</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
As you will learn, surplus lines insurers must meet various criteria to be allowed to write surplus lines insurance in any given state or legal jurisdiction.

Characteristics of Surplus Lines Insurers: Some of the Terms You Need to Know</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re discussing the characteristics of surplus lines insurers with insurers, clients, or other industry professionals, knowing these terms and when to use them will help you communicate more effectively:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
Domestic insurer&mdash;This is an insurer doing business in the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated. The insurer is said to be domiciled in that state, and it was formed and licensed according to the laws of that state. </i></li><li><i>
Foreign insurer&mdash;This is an insurer licensed to operate in a state but incorporated in another state. From the standpoint of insurance regulators of any United States state other than the state of incorporation, it is a foreign insurer.</i></li><li><i>
Alien insurer&mdash;This is an insurer domiciled in a country other than the U.S. From the standpoint of U.S. insurance regulators, it is an alien insurer.</i></li><li><i>
Admitted insurer&mdash;This is an insurer to which a state insurance department has granted a license to do business within that state.</i></li><li><i>
Nonadmitted insurer&mdash;This is an insurer not authorized by a state insurance department to do business within that state.</i></li><li><i>
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)&mdash;This is an association of insurance commissioners from the fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories and possessions, whose purpose is to coordinate insurance regulation activities among the various state insurance departments.</i></li><li><i>
Guaranty fund&mdash;This is a state-established fund that provides a system for the payment of some of the unpaid claims of insolvent insurers licensed in that state, generally funded by assessments collected from all insurers licensed in the state.</i></li><li><i>
NAIC Annual Statement&mdash;This is the primary financial statement prepared by insurers and required by every state insurance department.</i></li><li><i>
Focused differentiation strategy&mdash;This is a business-level strategy through which a company focuses on one group of customers and offers unique or customized products that permit it to charge a higher price than that of the competition.</i></li><li><i>
Target market niche&mdash;This is a collection of customers with similar characteristics that an organization identifies to meet the customers&rsquo; needs.</i></li><li><i>
Binding authority&mdash;This is a method of placing insurance in which a surplus lines intermediary can bind coverage for a particular submission that falls within the parameters of the binding authority contract without prior submission to the surplus lines insurer. </i></li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

Insurers can be categorized based on several characteristics, two of which are these:</p><ul><li>
Place of domicile</li><li>
Status as licensed or unlicensed in a given state</li></ul><p><span>
The place of domicile for an insurer is the state (or other United States jurisdiction, such as the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico) or country under whose laws the insurer is formed and licensed. Depending on its place of domicile, an insurer can be classified as a <a data-original-title="
An insurer doing business in its home jurisdiction." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
domestic insurer</a>,  a <a data-original-title="
An insurer licensed to operate in a jurisdiction but incorporated in another jurisdiction." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
foreign insurer</a>, or an <a data-original-title="
An insurer domiciled in a country other than the one in which it seeks to conduct, or is conducting, business." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
alien insurer</a> in a given state. </span><span>
For example, if an insurer is domiciled in California, it is a domestic insurer from the perspective of California&rsquo;s insurance regulators and a foreign insurer from the standpoint of insurance regulators of any other U.S. state. An insurer domiciled in Germany is an alien insurer from the perspective of insurance regulators in any U.S. state.</span></p><p><span>
An insurer also can be classified as an <a data-original-title="
An insurer to which a state insurance department has granted a license to do business within that state." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
admitted insurer</a> or a <a data-original-title="
An insurer not authorized by the state insurance department to do business within that state." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
nonadmitted insurer</a>. </span><span>
An insurer domiciled and licensed in California that is also licensed in Oregon and Nevada is a domestic admitted insurer in California and a foreign admitted insurer in Oregon and Nevada. That same insurer would be a foreign nonadmitted insurer in any other state. </span><span>
Every nonadmitted insurer is domiciled and licensed somewhere and is therefore an admitted insurer in that jurisdiction, which is responsible for regulating its operations and monitoring its solvency. </span></p><p>
When a nonadmitted insurer meets the criteria imposed by a state&rsquo;s surplus lines law, it becomes an eligible surplus lines insurer. It then is able to write business in that state through a surplus lines intermediary that has been licensed in accordance with that state&rsquo;s law. </p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Licensing: What&rsquo;s the Point?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
The categorization of an insurer is based on the perspective of the state insurance regulators who regulate the insurer&rsquo;s operations and monitor its solvency. Therefore, an insurer incorporated in state B is a foreign insurer from the perspective of state A, even though it is a domestic insurer from the perspective of state B. When an insurer is domiciled in state A and licensed to do business in a different state (state B), it is admitted in state B from the perspective of state B and is also a foreign insurer. A surplus lines intermediary, an agent or a broker licensed to write surplus lines insurance in a state, can procure a surplus lines policy from a nonadmitted insurer if that insurer meets the state&rsquo;s surplus lines criteria. As you will see, businesses place their surplus lines business with insurers that are qualified to write their business and that offer the best value for the business; therefore, understanding the various classifications is important to understanding how surplus lines insurers operate.</i></p><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"></div><div class="panel-body"><div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" data-target="#modal-N1026E" data-toggle="modal" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"><p align="right" data-target="#modal-N1026E" data-toggle="modal"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in"></span></p></div><div class="visible-xs-block visible-sm-block"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"></div><div aria-labelledby="modalLabel-N1026E" role="dialog" tabindex="-1" id="modal-N1026E" class="modal fade"><div role="document" class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button aria-label="Close" data-dismiss="modal" class="close" type="button"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button><h4 id="modalLabel-N1026E" class="modal-title"></h4></div><div class="modal-body"><div class="container-fluid"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><span class="daid">

Admitted Specialty Insurers</b></p><p>
Some admitted insurers specialize in niche markets, accepting some of the risks usually placed in the surplus lines market. They are not surplus lines insurers, but they provide some of the same coverages as surplus lines insurers. An admitted specialty insurer may be a subsidiary of a group of companies under common ownership that also includes one or more surplus lines insurers. As admitted insurers, these organizations are subject to rate and form filing regulations in each state in which they operate. Therefore, they do not have the same flexibility as surplus lines insurers to respond to new and unusual risks. However, they may have comparable specialty underwriting expertise.</p></div><div class="panel-footer"><span class="daid">

Before July 21, 2011, each state established its own eligibility criteria for nonadmitted insurers wishing to write surplus lines business within its jurisdiction. Only nonadmitted insurers that met these criteria were recognized as authorized nonadmitted insurers, also referred to as eligible surplus lines insurers. </span><span>
This situation created challenges for surplus lines intermediaries, particularly when handling multistate accounts, because a nonadmitted insurer could be eligible to write surplus lines business in some states and ineligible in others. </span></p><p><span>
The federal Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (NRRA), which took effect on July 21, 2011, simplified the situation by imposing national eligibility standards for surplus lines insurers domiciled in any U.S. jurisdiction. </span><span>
The states must incorporate the national eligibility standards into their surplus lines laws. These standards are set out in Sections 5A(2) and 5C(2)(a) of the Nonadmitted Insurance Model Act developed and published by the <a data-original-title="
An association of insurance commissioners from the fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories and possessions, whose purpose is to coordinate insurance regulation activities among the various state insurance departments." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)</a>.</span></p><p>
To be an eligible surplus lines insurer in a given state, a nonadmitted insurer domiciled in the U.S. must be licensed in its home state and must have capital and surplus equal to the greater of $15 million or the capitalization requirement specified by the state in which it wants to write surplus lines business. A state&rsquo;s insurance commissioner has the authority to make an exception and authorize a nonadmitted insurer with less capitalization to write surplus lines business in that state, provided the insurer has at least $4.5 million in capital and surplus.</p><p><span>
Alien insurers wishing to write surplus lines business in the U.S. must maintain a trust fund or other collateral in the U.S. They also must submit financial statements and other documentation to the states in which they write business and to the NAIC. </span><span>
The International Insurers Department (IID) of the NAIC monitors the performance and financial strength of these alien insurers and publishes a Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers. Licensed surplus lines intermediaries are permitted to place business with any alien insurer on that list. </span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

guaranty funds</a> generally do not cover the policyholders of surplus lines insurers. As a result, determining the solvency of these insurers is essential. </p><p>
A.M. Best Company, Inc. is an international credit rating organization that focuses on the insurance industry. Analysts at A.M. Best evaluate the financial strength of individual companies and assign a Best&rsquo;s Rating, which can range from A++ for companies with superior financial strength to E for companies under regulatory supervision because of poor financial performance and F for companies in liquidation. </p><p><span>
The sources of information for assigning Best's Ratings are the <a data-original-title="
The primary financial statement prepared by insurers and required by every state insurance department." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
NAIC Annual Statement</a> and quarterly statements filed by individual insurers. These may be supplemented by audit reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reports, records of insurance department examinations, and internal insurer documents. </span><span>
The ratings are reviewed quarterly, although mergers, catastrophic losses, reinsurer insolvencies, or other unusual events might necessitate additional reviews.</span></p><p><span>
A.M. Best considers an insurer to be a Financially Impaired Company (FIC) when a state insurance department takes regulatory action because of concerns about the insurer's financial condition, the adequacy of its capital and surplus, or its ability to conduct normal insurance operations. </span><span>
The rating agency tracks the frequency of financial impairment among both admitted insurers and surplus lines insurers. Between 1977 and 2010, the Financial Impairment Frequency (FIF) for surplus lines insurers was slightly higher than that of admitted insurers, 1.01 compared to 0.89.</span><a data-trigger="click" data-placement="bottom" data-toggle="popover" href="#"><sup class="footnote footnote-ref" audience="">1</sup></a><span style="display:none;" name="footnote-text">

The solvency of surplus lines insurers is crucial because state guaranty funds, which are established to help pay claims of insolvent insurers, are not available for surplus lines insurers. A.M. Best is an international credit rating organization that rates the financial strength of insurers, including surplus lines insurers. Producers and brokers who place surplus lines insurance for their customers should review the A.M.

The core operations of all property-casualty insurers, including surplus lines insurers, are marketing, underwriting, and claim handling. Because of the nature of the risks insured in the surplus lines market, these functions can be more challenging for surplus lines insurers. The insurance professionals involved in surplus lines transactions require specialized skills to operate successfully in this market.</p><p><span>
By their nature, surplus lines insurers pursue a <a data-original-title="
A business-level strategy through which a company focuses on one group of customers and offers unique or customized products that permit it to charge a higher price than that of the competition." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
focused differentiation strategy</a> by directing their efforts to insureds whose needs are not met by admitted insurers. Surplus lines insurers concentrate on serving segments of the property-casualty insurance market that are inadequately served by admitted insurers and in which they have specialized expertise. </span><span>
By focusing, an organization limits not only its market, but also the number of competitors. In that way, an insurer can reduce costs or provide products and services that differentiate it from this limited number of competitors. Succeeding in this approach, however, requires detailed knowledge and complete understanding of the <a data-original-title="
A collection of customers with similar characteristics that an organization identifies in order to meet their needs." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
target market niche</a>.</span></p><p></p><p>
The expertise of the surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s underwriters may influence which classes of business the insurer writes. For example, underwriting kidnap and ransom coverage for corporate executives stationed overseas requires detailed knowledge of the socio-political climate in the foreign country, local law enforcement, and appropriate risk control measures. </p><p><span>
Claim representatives working in surplus lines also require specialized expertise. For example, some insurers and independent adjusting firms maintain pollution liability teams that are prepared to go anywhere a major loss has occurred. These teams coordinate the mitigation of damages, prevent further damages, and handle claims. </span><span>
Because of the specialty nature of the business written in the surplus lines market, claims can be complex and require personnel with specialized skills and knowledge.</span></p><p><span>
Surplus lines insurers&rsquo; relationships with surplus lines intermediaries are essential to their success. When insurers work with intermediaries operating on a brokerage basis, the insurer&rsquo;s underwriters make the decision to accept or reject submissions. </span><span>
Other intermediaries have <a data-original-title="

binding authority</a> and complete the underwriting process for submissions that fall within the parameters established in their contracts with surplus lines insurers. </span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

Characteristics of Surplus Lines Insurers: That&rsquo;s a Wrap!</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re thinking about the topics we just discussed, it&rsquo;s helpful to remember these key points:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
	Insurers can be categorized based on characteristics such as their places of domicile and their status as licensed or unlicensed in a given state. Additionally, insurers can be classified as admitted or nonadmitted from the perspective of regulators in a given state, and nonadmitted insurers must meet the state&rsquo;s surplus lines law criteria to be licensed to write business in that state.</i></li><li><i>
To simplify the writing of surplus lines for intermediaries, national eligibility standards are imposed for surplus lines insurers domiciled in any U.S. jurisdiction. </i></li><li><i>
States must incorporate these standards into their surplus lines laws based on sections of the Nonadmitted Insurance Model Act developed by the NAIC. </i></li><li><i>
A U.S. domiciled, nonadmitted surplus lines insurer must be licensed in its home state and must have capital and surplus equal to the greater of $15 million or the capitalization requirement specified by the state in which it wants to write the business.</i></li><li><i>
To write surplus lines business in the U.S., an alien insurer must maintain a trust fund or other collateral in the U.S., and it must submit financial statements and other documentation to the states in which it writes business and to the NAIC.</i></li><li><i>
Solvency of surplus lines insurers is crucial, and A.M. Best evaluates financial strength, assigns a rating, and monitors financial strength.</i></li><li><i>
When a state insurance department takes regulatory action because of concerns about an insurer's financial condition, A.M. Best considers the insurer to be a Financially Impaired Company (FIC), and producers and brokers may not write surplus lines business for those insurers.</i></li><li><i>
