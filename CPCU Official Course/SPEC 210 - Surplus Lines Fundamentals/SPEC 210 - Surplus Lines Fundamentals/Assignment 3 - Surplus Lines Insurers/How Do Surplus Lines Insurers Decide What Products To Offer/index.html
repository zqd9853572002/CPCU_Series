Surplus Lines Product Offerings: Some of the Terms You Need to Know</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
When you&rsquo;re discussing the characteristics of surplus lines product offerings with co-workers, clients, or other industry professionals, knowing these terms and when to use them will help you communicate more effectively:</i></p><ul audience="CEU" class="overlay"><li><i>
Policyholders&rsquo; surplus&mdash;An insurer&rsquo;s assets minus its liabilities, which represents its net worth.</i></li><li><i>
Premium to surplus ratio&mdash;A capacity ratio that indicates an insurer&rsquo;s financial strength by relating net written premiums to policyholders&rsquo; surplus.</i></li><li><i>
Guaranty fund&mdash;A state-established fund that provides a system for the payment of some of the unpaid claims of insolvent insurers licensed in that state, generally funded by assessments collected from all insurers licensed in the state.</i></li><li><i>
Diligent search&mdash;The surplus lines regulatory requirement establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable from admitted insurers. The intermediary (producer or broker) must unsuccessfully conduct a diligent search to place the business with an insurer in the admitted market before placing it with an insurer in the nonadmitted market.</i></li><li><i>
Residual market&mdash;This term refers collectively to insurers and other organizations that, through a shared risk mechanism, make insurance available to those who cannot obtain coverage in the admitted market.</i></li><li><i>
Automobile insurance plans&mdash;Plans for insuring high-risk drivers in which all auto insurers doing business in the state are assigned their proportionate share of such drivers based on the total volume of auto insurance written in the state.</i></li><li><i>
	Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans&mdash;Insurance pools through which private insurers collectively address an unmet need for property insurance on urban properties, especially those susceptible to loss by riot or civil commotion.</i></li><li><i>
Adverse selection&mdash;The tendency for people with the greatest probability of loss to be the ones most likely to purchase insurance.</i></li><li><i>
Underwriting cycle&mdash;A cyclical pattern of insurance pricing in which a soft market (low rates, relaxed underwriting, and underwriting losses) is eventually followed by a hard market (high rates, restrictive underwriting, and underwriting gains) and then back again.</i></li><li><i>
Managing general agent (MGA)&mdash;An authorized agent of the primary insurer that manages all or part of the primary insurer&rsquo;s insurance activities, usually in a specific geographic area.</i></li><li><i>
Reinsurance&mdash;The transfer of insurance risk from one insurer to another through a contractual agreement under which one insurer (the reinsurer) agrees, in return for a reinsurance premium, to indemnify another insurer (the primary insurer) for some or all of the financial consequences of certain loss exposures covered by the primary's insurance policies.</i></li><li><i>
Treaty reinsurance&mdash;A reinsurance agreement that covers an entire class or portfolio of loss exposures and provides that the primary insurer&rsquo;s individual loss exposures that fall within the treaty are automatically reinsured.</i></li><li><i>
Facultative reinsurance&mdash;The reinsurance of individual loss exposures in which the primary insurer chooses which loss exposures to submit to the reinsurer, and the reinsurer can accept or reject any loss exposures submitted.</i></li><li><i>
Hard market&mdash;This describes market conditions in which insurer competition diminishes, buyers have difficulty finding coverage, premiums increase, and insurer profitability rises.</i></li><li><i>
Soft market&mdash;A soft market occurs when insurer competition is intense, as indicated by widely available coverage, lower premiums, and decreased insurer profitability.</i></li><li><i>
Capacity&mdash;The amount of business an insurer is able to write, usually based on a comparison of the insurer&rsquo;s written premiums to its policyholders&rsquo; surplus.</i></li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

policyholders&rsquo; surplus</a> insurers must maintain relative to the amount of premiums they write. This helps ensure that insurers have sufficient resources to meet their obligations to policyholders. </span><span>
A surplus lines insurer must consider how much of its policyholders&rsquo; surplus to allocate to each class of surplus lines business it wishes to write and what the acceptable <a data-original-title="

premium-to-surplus ratio</a> is for each class. To maintain an acceptable premium-to-surplus ratio, an insurer might restrict the amount of insurance it writes for some classes of business, or it might buy reinsurance to reduce the amount of premiums written. </span></p><p>
The insurer's financial rating also determines the types of products to sell. For certain classes of business, customers typically require a minimum financial rating, which an insurer must meet or exceed to compete successfully in those classes. These financial ratings are assigned by A.M. Best Company, which rates almost all insurers licensed and operating within the United States. </p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

Although regulation in the surplus lines market focuses on surplus lines intermediaries, regulations also influence the types of business a surplus lines insurer writes. States often mandate that certain classes of business be written by admitted insurers. For example, most states require that automobile liability insurance be written by admitted insurers to ensure policyholders have state <a data-original-title="

In addition, some states have export lists that identify classes of business that are exempt from the <a data-original-title="
A surplus lines regulatory requirement establishing that coverage for the risk is unavailable from admitted insurers." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
diligent search</a> requirement and can be exported to the surplus lines market without proof that the admitted market declined to provide coverage. </span></p><p><span>
Surplus lines insurers also consider <a data-original-title="

residual markets</a> operating in a given state when determining what products to offer. Business that can be written in residual markets, such as <a data-original-title="

underwriting cycle</a> can create a difficult competitive environment.</span></p><p>
One advantage for surplus lines insurers operating in states with residual market plans is that these plans are funded by assessing admitted insurers; nonadmitted insurers are generally not subject to residual market assessments.</p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

As you can see, a surplus lines insurer decides which products to offer after determining how much of its policyholders&rsquo; surplus to allocate to each class of surplus lines business and the acceptable premium to surplus ratio.

The expertise of the surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s underwriters may influence which classes of business the insurer writes. Because of their unusual nature, some classes of business require specialized knowledge in both underwriting and claim handling. If a surplus lines insurer wants to target these classes of business, the insurer must develop the needed skills among its staff, hire experienced staff, or use a <a data-original-title="

The states in which a surplus lines insurer is eligible to write insurance on a nonadmitted basis can be a factor in determining the classes of business the insurer will market. For example, an insurer wanting to write liability insurance for ski resorts must be eligible to write business in states where ski resorts are located. </p><p>
A surplus lines insurer also should consider a state&rsquo;s volume of surplus lines business. High premium volume might indicate great opportunity or a favorable regulatory environment.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">

An insurer's processing staff and computer system capabilities also are considerations in determining what products to offer. The number and type of policies written in a class of business determine the staff and technology needed to produce and process the book of business. </span><span>
If current processing cannot handle the policy transactions&mdash;for example, because of limitations in the computer system&rsquo;s capabilities&mdash;the surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s staff must make the necessary system changes or contract others to do so.</span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>

A: A surplus lines insurer may want to write classes of business that are excluded by treaty reinsurance agreements if, instead, the insurer can obtain facultative reinsurance to reduce the effect of potential large losses. The insurer&rsquo;s eligibility to write surplus lines insurance on a nonadmitted basis in a state encourages it to market that class of business, especially if the state has high premium volume of surplus lines business.

Taxation of admitted and nonadmitted business can affect the choice of products offered. </span><span>
An admitted insurer pays state premium taxes, calculated as a percentage of the insurer&rsquo;s written premiums. Admitted insurers file these taxes directly with the states in which they are licensed and include taxes in their ratemaking formulas. </span></p><p><span>
Taxes on nonadmitted business are shown as a separate, additional item on the invoice presented to the policyholder by either the insurer or the surplus lines intermediary. The surplus lines intermediary collects these taxes and remits them with a tax return to the insurance department in the insured&rsquo;s home state. </span><span>
These taxes are often higher than those paid by admitted insurers, which increases the total premiums that policyholders pay. Although surplus lines insurers do not pay the taxes directly, they consider the tax rate as one marketing factor when determining which products to offer in certain states.</span></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
The Insurance Underwriting Cycle</h1></div><div audience="CEU" class="overlay"><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><a href="07029AudioS11.mp3" aria-label="Audio File" role="button" class="btn btn-primary audioFile"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up"></span>

        </a></p></div><p><span>
The premium volume, coverages, and classes of business written in the surplus lines market fluctuate with the insurance underwriting cycle. </span><span>
Like many industries, the insurance business is cyclical: premiums, insurers&rsquo; profits, and coverage availability rise and fall in a pattern. The insurance cycle has a <a data-original-title="
Market conditions in which insurer competition diminishes, buyers have difficulty finding coverage, premiums increase, and insurer profitability rises." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
hard market</a> phase and a <a data-original-title="
Market conditions in which insurer competition is intense and is indicated by widely available coverage, lower premiums, and decreased insurer profitability." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
soft market</a> phase. </span></p><p><span>
A hard market begins when insurers tighten underwriting standards and sharply raise premiums. During this phase, insurers pare their business to only the more profitable risks. </span><span>
Because of changes in underwriting standards during hard markets, admitted insurers decline more submissions, which are then offered to surplus lines insurers. For this reason, there is usually an influx of insureds from the admitted market into the surplus lines market during the hard market phase. </span></p><p><span>
Stricter underwriting and higher premiums in a hard market result in increased profits, which attract more capital to the insurance industry and increase underwriting <a data-original-title="
The amount of business an insurer is able to write, usually based on a comparison of the insurer's written premiums to its policyholders' surplus." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
capacity</a>. This, in turn, leads to a soft market, in which insurers relax underwriting standards and lower premiums to attract more business. </span><span>
Most insureds can secure coverage from admitted insurers, and fewer insureds must seek coverage in the surplus lines market. Eventually, the relaxed underwriting standards generate more losses and decreased profits, and the cycle begins again with hard market conditions. </span></p><p><span>
Surplus lines premiums typically expand during a hard market and contract during a soft market. Moreover, a surplus lines insurer may adjust product offerings in a hard market to add coverages that were available from admitted insurers during the preceding soft market but are no longer available in the hard market. </span><span>
In a soft market, a surplus lines insurer may stop writing coverages that are available from admitted insurers and focus on marketing coverages that remain unavailable in the admitted market. </span></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
The Insurance Underwriting Cycle: What&rsquo;s the Point?</i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
Surplus lines insurers in the nonadmitted market react to the insurance underwriting cycle in a manner that counters the reaction of the admitted insurance market. During a hard market, when admitted insurers are more selective in the types of exposures they will insure, surplus lines insurers expand their product offerings to add the coverages that cease to be available in the admitted insurance market. </i></p><p audience="CEU" class="overlay"><i>
During a soft market, admitted insurers loosen their underwriting standards and accept some exposures that were declined during the hard market.
