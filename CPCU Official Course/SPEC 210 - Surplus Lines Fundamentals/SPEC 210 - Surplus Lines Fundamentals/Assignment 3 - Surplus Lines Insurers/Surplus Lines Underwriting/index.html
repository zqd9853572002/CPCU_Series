Objective</p><p>
Describe the steps in the underwriting process and how underwriting practices in the surplus lines market differ from those in the admitted market.</p></div></div><p>
Surplus lines underwriters have more flexibility than underwriters in the admitted market. This flexibility allows surplus lines underwriters to make an otherwise unacceptable risk acceptable and meet the customer&rsquo;s insurance needs.</p><p><span>
Although surplus lines insurers and admitted insurers use essentially the same underwriting process, their underwriting practices differ in important ways. </span><span>
One difference is the more significant role that <a data-original-title="
An insurance agent's authority to effect coverage on behalf of the insurer." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
binding authority</a> plays in the surplus lines market. When an insurer provides binding authority to an intermediary, the intermediary performs the underwriting process for the insurer, but the insurer must perform additional underwriting tasks related to delegating binding authority. </span><span>
Another difference is that surplus lines <a data-original-title="
An insurer employee who evaluates applicants for insurance, selects those that are acceptable to the insurer, prices coverage, and determines policy terms and conditions." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
underwriters</a> have greater flexibility to modify policy premiums, policy provisions, insureds&rsquo; loss exposures, and the insurer&rsquo;s retention. This enables surplus lines insurers to provide a supplemental market for insureds unable to obtain coverage in the admitted market.</span></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
The Underwriting Process</h1></div><p>
The basic underwriting process is the same in the admitted market and the surplus lines market. Whether underwriters are employees of a surplus lines insurer or surplus lines intermediaries with binding authority, they use a process that includes these steps:</p><ol><li>
Gather the necessary information</li><li>
Make the underwriting decision</li><li>
Implement the underwriting decision</li><li>
Monitor the underwriting decision</li></ol><p><span>
To make an underwriting decision on new accounts, renewals, or policy changes, underwriters need adequate information. The insurance application or <a data-original-title="
A document that amends an insurance policy." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
endorsement</a> request is an essential source of underwriting data. </span><span>
Underwriters also can obtain important information from other sources, including producers; <a data-original-title="
A record that contains account information gathered as a result of a physical inspection by an insurer&rsquo;s risk control representative specifically at the request of an underwriter." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
risk control reports</a>; government records such as motor vehicle reports (MVRs); financial rating services such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s; claim files; and the applicant&rsquo;s or insured&rsquo;s own records, such as annual reports or financial statements.</span></p><p><span>
Once underwriters have gathered all pertinent information about an account, they need to determine its risk level, available underwriting options, and appropriate pricing. </span><span>
One way to determine risk level is by analyzing <a data-original-title="
A condition that increases the frequency or severity of a loss." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
hazards</a> associated with the account. To make an underwriting decision, an underwriter must consider whether these hazards make the overall level of risk desirable or undesirable. </span><span>
Based on their evaluation of an application, renewal, or policy change, underwriters have three options:</span></p><ul><li>
Accept it</li><li>
Reject it</li><li>
Accept it with modification</li></ul><p><span>
After making an underwriting decision, the underwriter implements the decision. If the decision is consistent with underwriting guidelines and within the underwriter&rsquo;s authority, he or she can approve the application, renewal, or policy change and request that appropriate documents be issued. </span><span>
If some aspect of the account exceeds the underwriter&rsquo;s authority, it will require a supervisor&rsquo;s approval. Whether the application is accepted, rejected, or accepted with modification, the decision is clearly communicated to the producer and to other insurer personnel.</span></p><p><span>
The underwriting process does not end when a policy is issued. </span><span>
The underwriter assesses the quality of initial underwriting decisions by monitoring claim activity on policies, policy changes that may indicate increased hazards, and overall profitability of the book of business for which he or she is responsible. </span><span>
Despite variations in the hazards or loss experience of individual accounts, the entire group of accounts an underwriter handles is expected to meet profitability goals established for the book of business. Careful monitoring of each account helps the underwriter meet these goals.</span></p><p><span>
Finally, as the policy expiration date approaches, the underwriter might need to repeat the underwriting process before agreeing to renew the policy. </span><span>
Renewal underwriting generally can be accomplished more quickly than new business underwriting because the insured is known to the underwriter and more information might be available because claim reports or risk control reports have been added to the file. However, the underwriter must determine whether any changes in the account have occurred and, if so, repeat the underwriting process.</span></p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Role of Binding Authority in the Surplus Lines Market</h1></div><p><span>
Intermediaries with binding authority are an important part of the surplus lines market. Insurers grant binding authority to intermediaries who have the expertise to successfully underwrite the classes of business the insurer wishes to pursue. </span><span>
The degree of binding authority depends on the insurer&rsquo;s philosophy, the intermediary&rsquo;s experience and profitability, and the type of insurance involved. The conditions, terms, and scope of the binding authority may vary by state to comply with regulations. </span></p><p>
Surplus lines insurers extend binding authority to qualified intermediaries for several reasons.&nbsp; Intermediaries understand the particular classes of business and types of specialized coverage handled within the binding authority. Moreover, intermediaries are familiar with the local territory in which the business is written and have relationships with the retail producers submitting the business. Extending binding authority to qualified intermediaries also saves insurers the cost of hiring and training additional employees.</p><p>
Surplus lines insurers provide specific guidelines to their intermediaries when extending binding authority. These guidelines specify acceptable territories, classes of business, maximum premiums and policy limits, mandatory endorsements, and other factors. The underwriting guidelines also indicate which submissions the intermediary must refer to a higher underwriting authority within the insurer. </p><p><span>
Binding authority relationships carry a different responsibility for underwriting profitability than brokerage relationships. In a brokerage relationship, the insurer makes the final decision to bind and issue the policy. In a binding authority relationship, the intermediary makes that decision based on the contract and guidelines the insurer provided. </span><span>
The selection of acceptable submissions is the intermediary&rsquo;s responsibility, and the insurer holds the intermediary accountable for underwriting results.</span></p><p><span>
Underwriting guidelines may require the intermediary to share a submission with the insurer before providing a quote. Generally, however, the insurer does not see an application until several weeks after the intermediary has bound coverage and the policy is in effect. </span><span>
The insurer then reviews the submission to confirm that the intermediary adhered to the underwriting guidelines. Insurers monitor binding authority business for profitability through post-underwriting reviews, risk control inspections, premium audits, and financial reviews.</span></p><p>
An insurer that grants binding authority to intermediaries must perform two additional tasks within its underwriting division:</p><ol><li>
Select the intermediaries that will receive binding authority</li><li>
Select the classes of business to be included in the binding authority</li></ol><p><span>
The process of selecting intermediaries for binding authority contracts generally begins with a specific marketing need on the part of either the insurer or the intermediary. The initial contact  can be made by either party, depending on where the need originates. </span><span>
When deciding whether to grant binding authority, a surplus lines insurer evaluates a number of factors, including these:</span></p><ul><li>
The intermediary&rsquo;s financial condition</li><li>
The intermediary&rsquo;s marketing needs</li><li>
The intermediary&rsquo;s underwriting expertise</li><li>
The intermediary&rsquo;s marketing area</li><li>
The intermediary&rsquo;s reputation</li><li>
The intermediary&rsquo;s other insurers</li><li>
The insurer&rsquo;s need for other intermediaries with binding authority in the marketing area</li></ul><p>
In addition to selecting intermediaries for binding authority contracts, surplus lines insurers also must decide which classes of business to include in the contracts. Insurers may consider any number of factors in making this decision. An insurer&rsquo;s plans to write new classes of business and the capabilities of its existing underwriters to handle those classes of business would be primary considerations. </p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Ability of Surplus Lines Market to Make Underwriting Modifications</h1></div><p>
The decision to accept or reject an application, policy change, or renewal is relatively simple. However, modifying an unacceptable or borderline account to make it acceptable requires greater underwriting expertise. While it is possible to make underwriting modifications in the admitted market, it is generally easier to make such modifications in the surplus lines market. </p><p><span>
Admitted insurers, relying on the <a data-original-title="
A mathematical principle stating that as the number of similar but independent exposure units increases, the relative accuracy of predictions about future outcomes (losses) also increases." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
law of large numbers</a>, typically limit their underwriting to loss exposures with a sufficiently large number of exposure units. This enables the insurer to use filed forms and rates and apply predetermined underwriting guidelines. </span><span>
The types of risks submitted to surplus lines insurers do not lend themselves to this approach, and surplus lines underwriters must be able to apply specialized underwriting knowledge and judgment, based on their experience in handling unusual risks. </span></p><p>
Surplus lines underwriters, whether they are insurer employees or intermediaries with binding authority, can exercise any of these options when attempting to make an otherwise unacceptable risk acceptable:</p><ul><li>
Modify the loss exposure through risk control</li><li>
Modify the policy premium</li><li>
Modify policy provisions, deductibles, or limits</li><li>
Modify the insurer&rsquo;s retention through facultative reinsurance</li></ul><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Modify the Loss Exposure Through Risk Control</h2></div><p><span>
One approach to modifying an unacceptable submission is requiring the applicant to implement <a data-original-title="
A conscious act or decision not to act that reduces the frequency and/or severity of losses or makes losses more predictable." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
risk control</a> measures to reduce hazards. </span><span>
For example, installing an automatic sprinkler system, adding a guard service or security system, and improving housekeeping and maintenance can reduce physical hazards. Some risk control measures are relatively inexpensive and simple to implement, while others require considerable capital investment. </span></p><p>
Generally, a surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s risk control representatives are proficient in the specialty classes of business the insurer writes. As a result, they can make sound risk control recommendations accompanied by well-reasoned, convincing explanations that help the intermediary &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the recommendations.</p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Modify the Policy Premium</h2></div><p><span>
Another way to make an unacceptable submission acceptable is to modify the policy premium. A surplus lines underwriter has greater flexibility in pricing coverage than an admitted underwriter because surplus lines insurers are not constrained by rate filing regulations. </span><span>
Experience, expertise, and good judgment all play important roles in selecting a rate that earns a reasonable profit yet is competitive enough to obtain the account. </span></p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Modify Policy Provisions, Deductibles, or Limits</h2></div><p>
Surplus lines underwriters can modify policy provisions because of their freedom from form filing regulations. For example, a policy can be modified to exclude a cause of loss that has resulted in frequent losses, omit an exclusion to provide a coverage the insured needs, or impose a condition, such as requiring a working burglar alarm system. </p><p>
An underwriter also can modify the policy deductible. For example, if an account has had a large number of small claims, increasing the deductible might make the submission acceptable. </p><p><span>
Changing policy limits is another approach to modifying an unacceptable submission. An insurer&rsquo;s underwriting guide usually specifies the maximum policy limits an underwriter can approve. </span><span>
The limits usually reflect <a data-original-title="

reinsurance</a> constraints or availability and possible catastrophic loss from a single loss exposure. If high policy limits are requested, the underwriter might suggest lower limits that are within the underwriter&rsquo;s authority. </span></p><p><span>
For property insurance, the underwriter must be alert for overinsurance that could indicate a moral hazard and might lead to a fraudulent loss. Underinsurance, however, is a more common problem. </span><span>
Adequate policy limits are essential to collect a premium commensurate with the loss exposure. From the insured&rsquo;s standpoint, adequate policy limits also meet <a data-original-title="
An insurance-to-value provision in many property insurance policies providing that if the property is underinsured, the amount that an insurer will pay for a covered loss is reduced." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
coinsurance</a> requirements and ensure an adequate loss recovery. </span></p><div class="h2"><h2 class="small">
Modify the Insurer&rsquo;s Retention Through Facultative Reinsurance</h2></div><p><span>
If an applicant is in a class of business not covered by the underwriter&rsquo;s <a data-original-title="
A reinsurance agreement that covers an entire class or portfolio of loss exposures and provides that the primary insurer's individual loss exposures that fall within the treaty are automatically reinsured." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
treaty reinsurance</a>, or if the amount of insurance needed exceeds net treaty capacity, the underwriter might be able to transfer a portion of the loss liability to a facultative reinsurer. <a data-original-title="
Reinsurance of individual loss exposures in which the primary insurer chooses which loss exposures to submit to the reinsurer, and the reinsurer can accept or reject any loss exposures submitted." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
Facultative reinsurance</a> transactions are negotiated individually. </span><span>
A surplus lines underwriter usually has established relationships with reinsurers or reinsurance intermediaries that can provide the types of facultative reinsurance needed for special risks. </span></p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2"></div><div class="col-md-8"><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"></div><div class="panel-body"><div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" data-target="#modal-N10306" data-toggle="modal" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"><p align="right" data-target="#modal-N10306" data-toggle="modal"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in"></span></p></div><div class="visible-xs-block visible-sm-block"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"></div><div aria-labelledby="modalLabel-N10306" role="dialog" tabindex="-1" id="modal-N10306" class="modal fade"><div role="document" class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button aria-label="Close" data-dismiss="modal" class="close" type="button"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button><h4 id="modalLabel-N10306" class="modal-title"></h4></div><div class="modal-body"><div class="container-fluid"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><span class="daid">

Dale is a licensed surplus lines intermediary who has been granted binding authority by Millstone Insurance. He has been approached by a retail producer looking for property and premises liability coverage for a vacant, forty-year-old, fire-resistive factory building.  The company that occupied the building has gone into receivership, and the bank holding the mortgage has taken possession. The building has been vacant for three months, and the bank anticipates it will take between six and nine months to sell. The retail producer is looking for $3 million property coverage on the building, replacement cost coverage, $2 million premises liability coverage, and a $500 property loss deductible. </p><p>
Dale knows this type of risk has historically been very profitable and the standard market rarely writes this class of business. The fact that the premises are in possession of the bank, rather than a failing business, makes it a more attractive risk. </p><p>
He begins by evaluating the risk control measures in place. The building is securely locked, the property is posted &ldquo;no trespassing,&rdquo; and the bank has contracted with a security company to patrol the premises on a regular basis. However, the automatic sprinkler system has been disconnected, and the heat in the building has been turned off. Dale stipulates that the sprinkler system must be reconnected and, because it is winter, sufficient heat maintained in the building to prevent the water system from freezing.</p><p>
Dale is aware that copper theft is a significant exposure in vacant buildings, and the factory&rsquo;s extensive copper plumbing system is an attractive target for thieves. He decides to modify the policy to exclude coverage for the copper piping. In addition, because of the building's age, he elects to provide the property coverage on an actual cash value basis rather than at replacement cost. Finally, he increases the deductible to $5,000.</p><p>
Dale knows this risk will fall within Millstone&rsquo;s reinsurance treaty, so facultative reinsurance will not be required. Based on his evaluation of the risk, Dale feels it is attractive, and he selects a rate high enough to make the account profitable but low enough to be attractive to the bank. He presents his proposal to the retail broker and a bank representative, who accept the coverage as offered. Dale completes the application, binds coverage, issues a binder, and submits the application and supporting documentation to Millstone Insurance.</p></div><div class="panel-footer"><span class="daid">
