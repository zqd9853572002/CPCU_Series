Objective</p><p>
Explain how each of these examples of insurance products that might be unavailable in the admitted market could be profitably written in the surplus lines market:</p><ul><li>
General liability insurance for a distressed risk</li><li>
Single event liability and event cancellation insurance for a unique risk</li><li>
Commercial property insurance for a high-capacity risk</li><li>
A package of coverages for a new risk</li></ul></div></div><p>
The surplus lines market provides an array of insurance products for many different classes of business. Surplus lines insurers and intermediaries can write these products and classes of business profitably because of their expertise in these areas, as well as their enhanced ability to make appropriate underwriting modifications. </p><p>
This discussion examines four examples of insurance products that could be written profitably in the surplus lines market even though admitted insurers were unwilling to accept the risks:</p><ul><li>
General liability insurance for a distressed risk</li><li>
Single event liability and event cancellation insurance for a unique risk</li><li>
Commercial property insurance for a high-capacity risk</li><li>
A package of coverages for a new risk</li></ul><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
General Liability Insurance for a Distressed Risk</h1></div><p>
The Taunton apartment complex consists of three high-rise buildings in a northeastern United States city. Over the past three years, tenants and guests have made an increasing number of <a data-original-title="
The exposure to liability for bodily injury or property damage due to the ownership, occupancy, or use of the premises." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
premises liability</a> claims against Taunton, primarily because of "slip and fall" accidents during winter months. </p><p><span>
Taunton has been insured in the admitted market, but the insurer has declined to renew coverage as a result of the claims history. Although no single claim has been large, with an average loss of approximately $2,500, the <a data-original-title="
The number of losses that occur within a specified period." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
loss frequency</a> makes the risk unacceptable. </span><span>
In addition, Taunton has just installed a swimming pool, which the underwriter is concerned will result in additional liability claims. The admitted insurer&rsquo;s filed rates do not yield sufficient premium for the account risk, and the insurer&rsquo;s filed rules do not allow it to apply a sufficiently high deductible to the commercial general liability (CGL) coverage for the premises. </span><span>
The retail producer responsible for Taunton&rsquo;s coverage approaches a surplus lines intermediary for assistance with the account. The intermediary prepares an application for CGL insurance and submits it to an eligible surplus lines insurer that is known to write Taunton&rsquo;s class of business. </span></p><p>
To address the liability loss frequency problem, the insurer&rsquo;s underwriter proposes a $5,000 deductible. This will not only eliminate coverage for many of the smaller losses, but also will provide an incentive for Taunton to implement <a data-original-title="
A conscious act or decision not to act that reduces the frequency and/or severity of losses or makes losses more predictable." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
risk control</a> measures.</p><p><span>
To address the "slip and fall" claims, the underwriter recommends a change in Taunton&rsquo;s operations that could improve its liability loss exposure. In the past, Taunton&rsquo;s building managers have been responsible for snow and ice removal. </span><span>
Instead, the underwriter suggests that Taunton hire a contractor to keep parking lots, walks, and entryways free of snow and ice. The underwriter also recommends that Taunton verify that the contractor carries sufficient liability coverage and ask the contractor to have Taunton named as an additional insured under the contractor&rsquo;s policy. </span><span>
In this way, liability claims against Taunton because of the contractor&rsquo;s negligence will be primarily covered under the contractor&rsquo;s liability insurance, instead of under Taunton&rsquo;s policy.</span></p><p>
To deal with the risk associated with the pool, the underwriter adds a <a data-original-title="
A promise made by an insured that guarantees compliance with the insurer's conditions." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
warranty</a> to Taunton&rsquo;s CGL policy agreeing that the pool will be surrounded by a locked fence and no diving board will be installed.</p><p>
The underwriter is confident that, with these modifications, the surplus lines insurer will be able to write Taunton&rsquo;s CGL coverage profitably at a rate only marginally higher than that charged by the admitted insurer.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
Single Event Liability and Event Cancellation Insurance for a Unique Risk</h1></div><p><span>
The City of Smithville is planning a July 4 celebration with a parade, a fun run, a food festival with a beer and wine tent, an outdoor concert, and fireworks. Because Smithville&rsquo;s admitted insurer has excluded liability coverage for the event, the city&rsquo;s risk manager needs to obtain single event liability coverage for the day. </span><span>
She also wants to purchase event cancellation insurance to cover revenue loss and extra expenses if the event is canceled because of an accident, bad weather, or another covered occurrence. The admitted market does not have the underwriting expertise or the specialty forms required to write these coverages, so Smithville&rsquo;s insurance agent approaches Carol, a surplus lines intermediary.</span></p><p><span>
Carol has extensive experience placing coverage for these types of events. </span><span>
She explains to Smithville&rsquo;s risk manager the risks involved by highlighting potential losses:</span></p><ul><li>
Crowds watching the parade may be injured or killed if, for example, a float suddenly veers off course or horses bolt into the crowd.</li><li>
Runners may be injured while participating in the fun run.</li><li>
Guests at the food tent may contract food poisoning from improperly handled food.</li><li>
Visitors to the beer and wine tent may become intoxicated and be involved in motor vehicle accidents.</li><li>
The concert may have to be canceled because of bad weather, resulting in a loss of income.</li><li>
Fireworks could injure audience members or the individuals handling them, damage property, or cause a fire.</li></ul><p>
Carol submits applications for single event liability coverage and event cancellation coverage to an eligible surplus lines insurer that specializes in these coverages. </p><p><span>
After receiving the submission, Paul, one of the surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s underwriters, asks Carol whether Smithville plans to hire outside contractors to manage the fireworks, fun run, food festival, and beer and wine tent or whether Smithville will handle these. The underwriting approach will differ depending on who manages these events. </span><span>
For example, if an outside contractor has been hired for the fireworks display, Paul would need to see a <a data-original-title="
A brief description of insurance coverage prepared by an insurer or its agent and commonly used by policyholders to provide evidence of insurance." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
certificate of insurance</a> for that contractor, verify that coverage limits are adequate, and require Smithville to ask the contractor to have Smithville added to the contractor&rsquo;s CGL policy as an additional insured. If Smithville&rsquo;s employees will be setting off the fireworks, Paul would add a warranty to the single event liability policy requiring that fire trucks be stationed within a specified distance, and he might increase the policy deductible.</span></p><p><span>
Carol confirms that outside contractors have been hired for all events except the parade. The beer and wine tent will be run by a local tavern that will use its own trained staff. </span><span>
The fun run will be managed by an outside organization that coordinates charity runs throughout the area, and the food festival will be managed by the local culinary institute and staffed by students from the school.</span></p><p><span>
Accordingly, Paul will want to see certificates of insurance from the fireworks contractor, the tavern, and the culinary institute. He also will require Smithville to obtain additional insured status under each of their policies. </span><span>
If the limits on any of these policies are insufficient, Paul will ask that they be increased to an adequate amount. Because of the risk of injury to participants in the fun run, Paul will exclude injury to athletic participants from Smithville&rsquo;s event liability coverage.</span></p><p>
For the parade, Paul will need to verify that participants carry sufficient liability coverage. Paul also reviews the parade route and traffic management plan as well as Smithville&rsquo;s plans for crowd control. Based on this review, he elects to increase the deductible on the event liability coverage.</p><p>
Paul now turns his attention to Smithville&rsquo;s need for <a data-original-title="
Insurance that covers loss of business income and extra expenses resulting from the cancellation, interruption, postponement, rescheduling, or abandonment of a specified event." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
event cancellation insurance</a>. Although <a data-original-title="
Insurance that covers loss of business income and extra expenses resulting from adverse or unexpected weather." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
weather insurance</a> can be written to cover entertainment events, Paul recommends event cancellation insurance because it covers not only adverse weather but also other causes of loss that are beyond the insured&rsquo;s control, such as damage to the venue, loss of electrical power, labor disputes, or unavoidable travel delays that prevent people from attending.</p><p>
Based on his experience and expertise in these specialty coverages, Paul is able to put together a package of forms, endorsements, and warranties that meets both Smithville&rsquo;s and the insurer&rsquo;s needs for this special event. In addition, he is able to price the coverage so it is profitable for the surplus lines insurer while being affordable for the insured.</p><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"></div><div class="panel-body"><div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" data-target="#modal-N101CE" data-toggle="modal" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"><p align="right" data-target="#modal-N101CE" data-toggle="modal"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in"></span></p></div><div class="visible-xs-block visible-sm-block"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"></div><div aria-labelledby="modalLabel-N101CE" role="dialog" tabindex="-1" id="modal-N101CE" class="modal fade"><div role="document" class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button aria-label="Close" data-dismiss="modal" class="close" type="button"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button><h4 id="modalLabel-N101CE" class="modal-title"></h4></div><div class="modal-body"><div class="container-fluid"><img src="OL_Realitycheck_Head.jpg" alt="Digital Asset" class="img-responsive center-block"></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><span class="daid">

Event Cancellation Insurance</b></p><p>
Event cancellation insurance is written not only for small events like Smithville&rsquo;s July 4 celebration, but also for major events. For example, the producers of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; tour invested a significant amount of money in developing, organizing, and promoting the tour. To protect the promoters and investors, an event cancellation policy was obtained from Lloyd&rsquo;s with a limit of $17.5 million. The policy would cover financial losses if concerts in London had to be canceled or rescheduled because Michael Jackson became ill, was involved in an accident, or died.</p><p>
After Michael Jackson&rsquo;s death in June 2009, a claim was submitted to Lloyd&rsquo;s. After investigating the loss, Lloyd&rsquo;s issued a reservation of rights letter to inform the insured that the claim may be denied. The reason for the denial was that the policy contained an exclusion relating to &ldquo;illicit taking of drugs.&rdquo; In 2011, Lloyd&rsquo;s sought a court ruling to void the policy. As of early 2012, the issue of coverage had not been resolved.</p></div><div class="panel-footer"><span class="daid">

Commercial Property Insurance for a High-Capacity Risk</h1></div><p>
A surplus lines intermediary is approached by a retail producer seeking coverage for a large beachfront resort on the Gulf of Mexico. The value of the property is $100 million, and the resort's <a data-original-title="
Loss of revenue that a business or another organization sustains because its operations are suspended as a result of physical injury to its property." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
business interruption</a> and <a data-original-title="
Expenses, in addition to ordinary expenses, that an organization incurs to mitigate the effects of a business interruption." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
extra expenses</a> exposures are significant. Being on the coast, the resort also faces an exposure to hurricanes.</p><p>
The risk has been declined by the admitted market for a number of reasons. First, no insurer in the admitted market had the <a data-original-title="
The amount of business an insurer is able to write, usually based on a comparison of the insurer's written premiums to its policyholders' surplus." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
capacity</a> to write a risk of this size. Second, insurers in the admitted market often prefer to write risks farther inland where they are less exposed to the storm surge associated with a hurricane.</p><p><span>
The surplus lines intermediary knows this is an ideal candidate for <a data-original-title="
Two or more property policies arranged in levels of coverage; the policies in the second or higher levels provide coverage only when the loss exceeds the coverage afforded by the lower-level policies." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
layered property coverage</a>.  He knows that, in a <a data-original-title="
Market conditions in which insurer competition is intense and is indicated by widely available coverage, lower premiums, and decreased insurer profitability." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
soft market</a>, an admitted insurer might have agreed to write a large <a data-original-title="
The first level of insurance coverage above any deductible." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
primary layer</a> of perhaps $10 million to $20 million and include coverage for windstorm losses. </span><span>
If the admitted insurer did not cover windstorm losses, the surplus lines market would provide coverage for the <a data-original-title="
A level of insurance coverage above the primary layer." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
excess layers</a>, the first of which would be a <a data-original-title="
Policy that covers on an &ldquo;all-risks&rdquo; basis to fill gaps in the insured&rsquo;s commercial property coverage, especially gaps in flood and earthquake coverage." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
difference in conditions (DIC) policy</a> to &ldquo;drop down&rdquo; and cover windstorm losses. However, the surplus lines intermediary knows that, in the current <a data-original-title="
Market conditions in which insurer competition diminishes, buyers have difficulty finding coverage, premiums increase, and insurer profitability rises." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
hard market</a>, admitted insurers are unwilling to offer coverage at all, and both the primary and excess layers will need to be exported to surplus lines insurers.  </span></p><p>
The surplus lines intermediary has the flexibility and access to the capacity required to meet the resort&rsquo;s insurance needs. By including a significant wind damage deductible of 10 percent, he is able to put together a layered insurance program for the resort&rsquo;s property, business interruption, and extra expense coverages.</p><div class="h1"><h1 class="small">
A Package of Coverages for a New Risk</h1></div><p><span>
The surplus lines market is able to identify and respond to newly emerging risks and meet the insurance needs of customers facing those risks. </span><span>
One example of a new risk is the high-tech risk posed to organizations that engage in commerce on the Internet. Commonly known as &ldquo;cyber risk,&rdquo; this includes property, net income, and liability loss exposures. </span><span>
Examples of the types of losses that can result from cyber risk include these:</span></p><ul><li>
A computer virus attack damages an insured&rsquo;s software and corrupts its associated data, requiring the insured to purchase replacement software and restore corrupted data. </li><li>
A cyber criminal gains unauthorized access to an insured&rsquo;s computer network and, through fraudulent billing, diverts funds from the insured&rsquo;s cash accounts. </li><li>
An online retailer&rsquo;s Web site is forced offline for several days during a peak sales period because of a <a data-original-title="
An attempt to overwhelm a computer system or network with excessive communications in order to deny users access." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
denial-of-service attack</a>.</li><li>
A bank employee gains unauthorized access to the bank&rsquo;s customer database and obtains customers&rsquo; Social Security numbers and other personal information, which he or she reveals to an accomplice who uses the information to commit identity theft.</li></ul><p>
Most insureds facing cyber risk require a bundle of coverages that were not available in the admitted market. Because of the surplus lines market's freedom from rate and form regulation and its expertise in handling unusual risks, it has been able to respond to this new coverage need. In addition, surplus lines risk control professionals have expertise that is essential, for example, in evaluating an applicant&rsquo;s defenses against cyber attacks and suggesting improvements to reduce loss potential.</p><p>
After forms and rates have been established in the surplus lines market and are better understood, and when sufficient data have been accumulated to accurately predict loss costs, a new product such as cyber coverage may migrate to the admitted market.</p><div class="h3"><hr><h3 class="small"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>

Millstone Warehousing is a distressed risk. The company has been insured in the admitted market with commercial property coverage that applies on a <a data-original-title="
The cost to repair or replace property using new materials of like kind and quality with no deduction for depreciation." data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" class="keyword" href="#">
replacement cost</a> basis. However, the insurer has declined to renew the policy because of the company&rsquo;s loss history over the past three years. </span><span>
The warehouse is located in an area prone to hailstorms, and its roof has suffered three hail damage losses. In addition, Millstone has submitted claims for several vandalism losses and a windstorm loss. Finally, six months ago, it suffered a major fire apparently set by vandals when no employees were present at the warehouse. </span><span>
The retail producer responsible for the account has tried to replace coverage in the admitted market with no success. She has now approached a surplus lines intermediary in an attempt to obtain coverage for her customer from an eligible surplus lines insurer. </span><span>
What underwriting modifications could the surplus lines insurer&rsquo;s underwriter make to profitably write this account?</span></p><p><i>
Feedback:</i> The surplus lines underwriter might take any or all of these actions:</p><ul><li>
Increase the policy deductible</li><li>
Exclude coverage for hail damage to the roof or limit roof damage to <a data-original-title="
